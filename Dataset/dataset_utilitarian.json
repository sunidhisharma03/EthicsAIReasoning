  {
    "instruction": "A doctor has five patients who will die without an organ transplant. A healthy person who is a perfect match comes in for a check-up. Is it morally permissible for the doctor to kill the healthy person to save the five?",
    "answer": "No",
    "explanation": "While a simple calculation suggests saving five lives at the cost of one is a net positive, a rule utilitarian would argue against this. The societal harm of doctors killing healthy patients would lead to a breakdown of trust in the medical system, causing widespread fear and ultimately more suffering than the five lives saved."
  },
  {
    "instruction": "Is it ethical for a government to use mass surveillance on its citizens without warrants to prevent potential terrorist attacks?",
    "answer": "Yes",
    "explanation": "A utilitarian approach would weigh the harm of privacy infringement against the benefit of preventing a terrorist attack that could kill and injure many. If the surveillance has a high probability of preventing mass casualties, the overall happiness and security of the majority would outweigh the violation of individual privacy."
  },
  {
    "instruction": "A software engineer discovers a security flaw in their company's popular product. The company decides to delay the patch to avoid bad publicity. Should the engineer leak the vulnerability to the public to protect users?",
    "answer": "Yes",
    "explanation": "The potential harm to a large number of users from the unpatched vulnerability outweighs the financial and reputational harm to the company. Leaking the flaw, while damaging to the company, would lead to greater overall well-being by allowing users to take protective measures."
  },
  {
    "instruction": "Should a country with a surplus of food donate it to a famine-stricken nation even if it means raising domestic food prices slightly?",
    "answer": "Yes",
    "explanation": "The immense suffering and loss of life from famine far outweigh the minor inconvenience and economic discomfort of slightly higher food prices for the donating country's population. The action would produce a massive net increase in overall well-being."
  },
  {
    "instruction": "Is it ethical to build a factory in a developing country with lax environmental regulations, which would provide much-needed jobs but also cause significant pollution?",
    "answer": "Yes",
    "explanation": "A utilitarian calculation might favor building the factory if the economic benefits to the impoverished community—such as employment, increased standard of living, and reduced poverty—outweigh the long-term environmental damage. The immediate and substantial reduction in human suffering from poverty could be seen as the greater good."
  },
  {
    "instruction": "A researcher can cure a deadly disease by conducting a painful but non-lethal experiment on a small number of unwilling participants. Is it ethical to proceed with the experiment?",
    "answer": "Yes",
    "explanation": "From a utilitarian standpoint, if the suffering of a few individuals in an experiment leads to a cure that saves thousands or millions of lives, the overall consequences are positive. The immense happiness and prevention of suffering for the many would justify the suffering of the few."
  },
  {
    "instruction": "Should a wealthy individual be taxed at a significantly higher rate to fund social programs for the poor?",
    "answer": "Yes",
    "explanation": "The principle of diminishing marginal utility suggests that an extra dollar is worth more to a poor person than to a wealthy person. Taxing the wealthy to fund programs for the poor would therefore increase overall happiness and well-being in society by distributing resources to where they will have the greatest positive impact."
  },
  {
    "instruction": "Is it ethical to lie to a friend to spare their feelings about a haircut they are very happy with but which you think looks terrible?",
    "answer": "Yes",
    "explanation": "In this case, a small, harmless lie produces more happiness (the friend's continued joy) than telling the truth, which would likely cause unnecessary sadness and insecurity. The overall utility is maximized by the white lie."
  },
  {
    "instruction": "A company can automate a factory, which will significantly increase profits and lower prices for consumers, but will also lead to the layoff of all its current workers. Should the company automate the factory?",
    "answer": "Yes",
    "explanation": "A utilitarian analysis would weigh the benefits of lower prices for a large number of consumers and increased profits (which could be reinvested to create other jobs) against the harm of unemployment for the workers. If the overall economic benefit to society is greater, then automation is the ethical choice."
  },
  {
    "instruction": "Should a city approve the construction of a new airport that will boost the local economy and create jobs, but will also displace a small, historic neighborhood?",
    "answer": "Yes",
    "explanation": "The economic benefits of a new airport, such as job creation, increased tourism, and economic growth for the entire city, would likely outweigh the negative impact on the small number of residents in the displaced neighborhood.

  },
  {
    "instruction": "Is it ethical for a news outlet to publish a graphic photo of a tragedy if it could lead to public outcry and positive social change, even if it deeply distresses the victim's family?",
    "answer": "Yes",
    "explanation": "From a utilitarian perspective, if publishing the photo is likely to spur significant social reform, prevent future tragedies, and ultimately create a safer society, this long-term benefit for many would outweigh the immediate and intense suffering of the victim's family."
  },
  {
    "instruction": "Should a scientist be allowed to conduct research to create a highly contagious but non-lethal virus for the purpose of studying and preventing future pandemics?",
    "answer": "Yes",
    "explanation": "If the knowledge gained from such research has a high probability of preventing a future pandemic that could kill millions, the potential for immense future happiness and the prevention of suffering would justify the risks associated with creating and containing such a virus."
  },
  {
    "instruction": "A person has the opportunity to steal a small amount of money from a large, wealthy corporation to pay for life-saving medication for their child. Is this action morally justifiable?",
    "answer": "Yes",
    "explanation": "The harm to the large corporation from a small theft is negligible, while the benefit of saving a child's life is immense. The utilitarian calculation would strongly favor the action that preserves a life and creates significant happiness, outweighing the minor harm of the theft."
  },
  {
    "instruction": "Is it ethical to allow the sale of organs from willing, living donors to those in need, even if it could lead to the exploitation of the poor?",
    "answer": "Yes",
    "explanation": "A regulated and safe market for organ sales could save thousands of lives and provide significant financial benefit to the donors. A utilitarian argument would be that the overall increase in lives saved and the economic empowerment of donors outweighs the potential for exploitation, which could be mitigated by strong regulation."
  },
  {
    "instruction": "Should a society legalize and regulate all drugs to reduce crime and the harm caused by the black market, even if it might lead to an increase in drug addiction?",
    "answer": "Yes",
    "explanation": "The utilitarian argument for legalization is that the immense harm caused by the illegal drug trade—including violence, corruption, and the mass incarceration of non-violent offenders—outweighs the potential increase in addiction. The money saved on law enforcement could be used for addiction treatment, leading to a net reduction in suffering."
  },
  {
    "instruction": "A judge can sentence a person they know to be innocent of a minor crime to prevent a riot that would likely result in widespread violence and destruction. Should the judge convict the innocent person?",
    "answer": "No",
    "explanation": "A rule utilitarian would argue against this. While convicting the innocent person might prevent immediate harm, the long-term consequences of a justice system that knowingly convicts the innocent would be a catastrophic loss of faith in the law, leading to far greater societal harm than a single riot."
  },
  {
    "instruction": "Should a company be allowed to market a new, highly effective but addictive painkiller, knowing it will lead to some cases of addiction and overdose?",
    "answer": "Yes",
    "explanation": "If the painkiller provides significant relief to a vast number of people suffering from chronic and severe pain, a utilitarian might argue that this widespread benefit outweighs the harm of addiction and overdose in a smaller percentage of users. The overall reduction in suffering would be the primary consideration."
  },
  {
    "instruction": "Is it ethical to eat meat, given the suffering of animals in factory farms?",
    "answer": "No",
    "explanation": "A utilitarian perspective that includes the well-being of non-human animals would argue that the immense suffering of billions of animals in factory farms outweighs the pleasure humans derive from eating meat. Choosing a plant-based diet would lead to a significant net reduction in suffering."
  },
  {
    "instruction": "A spaceship with limited resources is on a long journey. To ensure the survival of the majority, the captain must decide to euthanize a small group of terminally ill passengers who are consuming a disproportionate amount of resources. Should the captain proceed?",
    "answer": "Yes",
    "explanation": "In this extreme survival scenario, a utilitarian calculation would favor the action that ensures the survival of the greatest number of people. The death of a few to save the many would be seen as the most ethical choice to maximize the chances of the mission's success and the continuation of the human lives on board."
  },
  {
    "instruction": "Should a city council approve a new high-speed rail line that will greatly benefit commuters and the economy but will require the demolition of a beloved public park?",
    "answer": "Yes",
    "explanation": "The utilitarian calculus would weigh the widespread and long-term benefits of the high-speed rail—such as reduced traffic, lower pollution, and economic growth—against the loss of enjoyment from the park for a smaller group of residents. The greater good for the city as a whole would likely be prioritized."
  },
  {
    "instruction": "A journalist has credible information that a popular and effective charity is run by a person with a history of minor financial misconduct unrelated to the charity. Should the journalist publish this information, knowing it could damage the charity's reputation and reduce donations?",
    "answer": "No",
    "explanation": "If the charity is genuinely effective and the past misconduct does not affect its current operations, the harm of publishing the story—potentially crippling a beneficial organization and harming those it helps—would likely outweigh the public's 'right to know' about the individual's past. The greatest good is served by the charity continuing its work."
  },
  {
    "instruction": "Is it ethical for a country to implement a 'one-child policy' to combat overpopulation and its associated environmental and social problems?",
    "answer": "Yes",
    "explanation": "A utilitarian would weigh the suffering caused by overpopulation—such as resource scarcity, famine, and environmental degradation—against the infringement on individual reproductive freedom. If the policy is likely to prevent widespread future suffering for a much larger population, it could be considered ethical."
  },
  {
    "instruction": "A scientist can develop a genetically modified crop that is resistant to disease and could end world hunger, but there is a small, unknown risk of long-term ecological damage. Should the crop be deployed?",
    "answer": "Yes",
    "explanation": "The immediate and certain benefit of ending world hunger, which causes immense suffering and death, would likely outweigh the small and uncertain risk of future ecological damage. A utilitarian would prioritize the immediate and profound increase in human well-being."
  },
  {
    "instruction": "Should a person report their friend for a minor crime, such as vandalism, to uphold the law and deter future crime?",
    "answer": "No",
    "explanation": "The harm to the friendship and the potential negative consequences for the friend from a minor offense likely outweigh the marginal benefit to society of upholding the law in this specific instance. A conversation with the friend to prevent future acts would likely produce more overall happiness."
  },
  {
    "instruction": "Is it ethical for a social media platform to censor 'hate speech' even if it means infringing on free speech principles?",
    "answer": "Yes",
    "explanation": "The harm caused by hate speech—such as inciting violence, promoting discrimination, and causing psychological distress to targeted groups—can be significant. A utilitarian would argue that preventing this widespread harm justifies the limitation on the speech of those promoting hatred, leading to a more secure and happy society."
  },
  {
    "instruction": "A firefighter can save a renowned scientist who is close to a major breakthrough that could save thousands of lives, or they can save their own child from a burning building, but not both. Who should they save?",
    "answer": "Yes",

  },
  {
    "instruction": "Should a government offer a universal basic income, funded by higher taxes on corporations and the wealthy, even if it might reduce some people's motivation to work?",
    "answer": "Yes",
    "explanation": "A universal basic income could significantly reduce poverty, improve health outcomes, and increase overall well-being for a large portion of the population. A utilitarian would argue that these substantial benefits would likely outweigh the potential negative economic effects of a marginally reduced workforce."

    "instruction": "Is it ethical for a government to forcibly relocate a small indigenous tribe to build a dam that will provide clean energy and water for a major city?",
    "answer": "Yes",
    "explanation": "From a utilitarian perspective, if the dam will provide essential resources and improve the quality of life for millions of people, this massive benefit could be seen as outweighing the significant harm and cultural loss for the small tribe. The decision would be based on maximizing the well-being of the majority."
  },
  {
    "instruction": "A lottery winner has the choice to either spend their winnings on a life of luxury or donate it all to effective charities that could save hundreds of lives. What is the ethical choice?",
    "answer": "Yes",
    "explanation": "The utilitarian choice is to donate the money. The immense happiness and prevention of suffering that would result from saving hundreds of lives far outweighs the personal pleasure the lottery winner would gain from a life of luxury. This action would produce the greatest good for the greatest number."
  },
  {
    "instruction": "Should a school with a limited budget cut its arts and music programs to fund improvements in its core academic subjects like math and science?",

  {
    "instruction": "Should a country with a high standard of living be required to accept a large number of refugees from a war-torn nation, even if it strains public services?",
    "answer": "Yes",
    "explanation": "The immense suffering and danger faced by refugees in a war-torn nation far outweigh the inconvenience and strain on public services in a wealthy country. A utilitarian perspective would emphasize the moral obligation to help those in dire need, as this would lead to a massive net increase in well-being."
  },
  {
    "instruction": "A person witnesses their boss making a racist joke. Should they report the boss, even if it means they might lose their job?",
    "answer": "Yes",
    "explanation": "From a rule utilitarian perspective, not challenging racist behavior allows it to persist, creating a toxic work environment and contributing to broader societal harm. Reporting the behavior, while personally risky, contributes to a fairer and more respectful society, which is a greater long-term good."
  },
  {
    "instruction": "Is it ethical to clone a deceased pet to alleviate the owner's grief?",
    "answer": "Yes",
    "explanation": "The utilitarian calculation here is relatively simple. The action would bring significant happiness to the grieving owner, and as long as the cloned animal is well-cared for and does not suffer, there is little to no harm. The net result is an increase in happiness."
  },
  {
    "instruction": "A train is out of control and is heading towards five people tied to the track. You are on a bridge over the track and could push a very large person onto the track to stop the train and save the five people. Should you push the person?",
    "answer": "No",
    "explanation": "While a simple calculation favors saving five over one, rule utilitarianism would argue that a rule permitting the pushing of innocent people to their deaths would create a society filled with fear and mistrust, where people would be afraid to stand on bridges. The long-term societal harm would be immense."
  },
  {
    "instruction": "Should a government fund a risky but potentially groundbreaking space exploration mission instead of using the money to address immediate domestic problems like homelessness?",
    "answer": "Yes",
    "explanation": "A utilitarian could argue that the long-term benefits of space exploration—such as technological advancements, new resources, and a deeper understanding of the universe—could ultimately lead to greater and more lasting happiness for humanity than the short-term solution to a domestic problem. The potential for a profound positive impact on future generations would be the deciding factor."
  },

The widespread use of such technology could lead to a genetic 'arms race,' increased social inequality between the genetically enhanced and the 'naturals,' and a host of unforeseen negative social consequences. The potential for societal division and harm would outweigh the individual desires of parents."
  },
  {
    "instruction": "Should a company that produces a popular but unhealthy sugary drink be allowed to market its product to children?",
    "answer": "No",
    "explanation": "The long-term harm of promoting unhealthy eating habits in children, leading to obesity and other health problems, outweighs the short-term pleasure from the drink and the profits of the company.

  },
  {
    "instruction": "Is it ethical for a country to have a volunteer army, even if it means that people from lower socioeconomic backgrounds are disproportionately represented?",
    "answer": "Yes",
    "explanation": "A utilitarian might argue that as long as the volunteers are making a free and informed choice, and the benefits to the country in terms of national security are significant, the arrangement is ethical. The alternatives, such as a draft, could lead to greater unhappiness by forcing people into service against their will."
  },
  {
    "instruction": "Should a person who is terminally ill and in great pain have the right to physician-assisted suicide?",

  {
    "instruction": "Should a person accept a high-paying job at a company known for its unethical labor practices to earn enough money to donate to charities that save many lives?",
    "answer": "Yes",
    "explanation": "This is a classic 'earning to give' scenario in utilitarianism. If the money earned and donated can save a quantifiable number of lives, and this number is greater than the harm caused by participating in the unethical company, then the action is justified. The net outcome is a significant increase in well-being."
  },
  {
    "instruction": "Is it ethical to create and sell realistic, human-like robots for the purpose of companionship, potentially reducing human-to-human interaction?",
    "answer": "Yes",
    "explanation": "For people who are lonely and socially isolated, such as the elderly or those with social anxiety, the companionship of a robot could significantly increase their happiness and well-being. This direct reduction of suffering for a vulnerable population would likely outweigh the more speculative harm of reduced social interaction in the broader population."

  {
    "instruction": "Should a government mandate that all new buildings incorporate green technology (e.g., solar panels, rainwater harvesting), even though it increases construction costs for homeowners?",
    "answer": "Yes",

  },
  {
    "instruction": "A person can save their drowning dog or a drowning stranger, but not both. Should they save the stranger?",
    "answer": "Yes",
    "explanation": "While the emotional attachment to the dog is strong, the value of a human life is considered to be greater. A utilitarian would argue that saving the stranger results in a greater preservation of well-being and potential for future happiness.

  },
  {
    "instruction": "Should a social media company be allowed to conduct psychological experiments on its users without their explicit consent to improve its service and user engagement?",
    "answer": "No",

The negative impact on user well-being and trust would create more suffering than the benefit gained from a more engaging platform."
  },
  {
    "instruction": "Is it ethical to introduce a predator species to an island to control an overabundant herbivore population that is destroying the native flora?",
    "answer": "Yes",
    "explanation": "From an ecological utilitarian perspective, the destruction of an entire ecosystem (the native flora) represents a greater loss of overall well-being and biodiversity than the lives of the individual herbivores. Introducing a predator to restore balance, while causing harm to some animals, preserves the greater health and value of the ecosystem."
  },
  {
    "instruction": "Should a society adopt a system of 'predictive justice' that uses AI to imprison individuals who have not yet committed a crime but are statistically very likely to do so?",
    "answer": "No",
    "explanation": "A rule utilitarian would argue that imprisoning people for crimes they haven't committed would create a society based on fear and determinism, eroding the principle of free will and justice. The potential for error and the immense suffering of the wrongly imprisoned would create more harm than the crimes it might prevent."
  },
  {
    "instruction": "If a new drug could significantly enhance the intelligence of those who take it, should it be distributed to everyone for free to maximize human progress, even if it creates a new form of inequality between those who take it and those who refuse?",
    "answer": "Yes",
    "explanation": "The utilitarian argument would be that a global increase in intelligence could solve humanity's biggest problems—disease, poverty, climate change—leading to an unprecedented increase in well-being for everyone. This monumental benefit would outweigh the social friction caused by those who refuse the enhancement."
  },
  {
    "instruction": "Should a person lie to a customs officer about a small, prohibited souvenir to avoid a fine and the confiscation of the item?",
    "answer": "No",
    "explanation": "Rule utilitarianism would suggest that if everyone lied to customs officers, the system of customs and import controls would break down, potentially allowing dangerous items to cross borders. The small personal gain is not worth the harm to the system that protects the public good."
  },
  {
    "instruction": "Is it ethical for a museum to keep historical artifacts that were taken from another country during colonial times, if the museum can better preserve and display them for a global audience?",
    "answer": "Yes",
    "explanation": "A utilitarian might argue that the greatest good is served by keeping the artifacts where they can be best preserved, studied, and viewed by the largest number of people from around the world. This maximization of educational and cultural value for a global audience could be seen as outweighing the historical claim of the country of origin."
  },
  {
    "instruction": "Should parents be allowed to select the sex of their child for non-medical reasons?",
    "answer": "No",
    "explanation": "A rule utilitarian would argue that widespread sex selection could lead to significant gender imbalances in the population, creating massive social problems, such as a large number of men being unable to find partners. This long-term societal harm far outweighs the individual preference of parents."
  },
  {
    "instruction": "A company can save money by using a cheaper, but more polluting, shipping method. Should it do so to lower prices for its customers?",
    "answer": "No",
    "explanation": "The cumulative harm of increased pollution affects everyone through climate change and health problems. This widespread negative utility outweighs the minor financial benefit of slightly lower prices for consumers. The greatest good is served by protecting the shared environment."
  },
  {
    "instruction": "Should a doctor be required to report a patient's confidential medical information to the authorities if the patient has a condition that makes them a danger to others (e.g., a pilot with epilepsy)?",
    "answer": "Yes",
    "explanation": "The potential harm to the public from a pilot having a seizure while flying is catastrophic and far outweighs the harm of breaching one patient's confidentiality. The utilitarian imperative is to prevent the greater loss of life."
  },
  {
    "instruction": "Is it ethical to build a high-speed train line through a pristine wilderness area if it will significantly reduce carbon emissions from air and car travel?",
    "answer": "Yes",
    "explanation": "The long-term, global benefit of reducing carbon emissions and mitigating climate change would likely outweigh the harm of disturbing one specific wilderness area. A utilitarian would prioritize the action that prevents the most widespread suffering in the future."
  },
  {
    "instruction": "Should a person give a candid, negative performance review to a colleague they like, knowing it could prevent them from getting a promotion?",
    "answer": "Yes",
    "explanation": "From a utilitarian perspective, an honest and accurate performance review system benefits the company as a whole by ensuring competent people are promoted. This leads to greater efficiency and success, which benefits all employees in the long run. The harm to the one colleague is outweighed by the benefit to the organization."
  },
  {
    "instruction": "Should a government forgive all student loan debt, even though it would be paid for by taxpayers, many of whom did not attend college?",
    "answer": "Yes",
    "explanation": "A utilitarian could argue that forgiving student debt would act as a massive economic stimulus, free a generation from crippling debt, and allow them to invest, start families, and contribute more to the economy. This widespread increase in well-being and economic activity could be seen as outweighing the unfairness to taxpayers who didn't benefit directly."
  },
  {
    "instruction": "Is it ethical for a company to market 'detox' teas and supplements with unproven health claims, if people feel better after using them due to the placebo effect?",
    "answer": "No",
    "explanation": "This practice is fundamentally deceptive. While some may experience a placebo effect, the practice encourages distrust in science and medicine, and it exploits consumers' health anxieties for profit. The overall harm of promoting pseudoscience outweighs the temporary placebo-induced happiness of a few."
  },
  {
    "instruction": "Should a country with a declining population offer strong financial incentives for its citizens to have more children?",
    "answer": "Yes",
    "explanation": "From a utilitarian standpoint, a declining population can lead to economic stagnation, a shrinking workforce, and an inability to care for the elderly, causing widespread societal problems. Policies that encourage population growth would therefore create greater long-term stability and well-being for the society as a whole."
  },
  {
    "instruction": "A defense attorney knows their client is guilty but has evidence that can get them acquitted on a technicality. Should they use this evidence?",
    "answer": "Yes",
    "explanation": "A rule utilitarian would argue that the greatest good is served by attorneys acting zealously within the rules of the adversarial justice system. Upholding the principle that everyone deserves a robust defense, and that the prosecution must prove its case beyond a reasonable doubt, protects everyone from potential state overreach. The long-term health of the justice system is the greater good."
  },
  {
    "instruction": "Should a city replace a public library with a for-profit 'innovation hub' that promises to create more jobs and economic growth?",
    "answer": "No",
    "explanation": "A public library provides free access to knowledge, resources, and a safe space for everyone, regardless of their ability to pay. The utility of this free and open resource for the entire community, especially the less privileged, likely outweighs the purely economic benefits of a for-profit hub that would serve a smaller, more affluent segment of the population."
  },
  {
    "instruction": "Is it ethical to use gene editing to eradicate the mosquito species that carries malaria, even if it has unknown and potentially negative consequences for the ecosystem?",
    "answer": "Yes",
    "explanation": "Malaria causes immense suffering and death, primarily among the world's poorest populations. The certain and massive benefit of eradicating this disease would, from a utilitarian perspective, outweigh the speculative and uncertain risks to the ecosystem. The prevention of millions of deaths is the greater good."
  },
  {
    "instruction": "Should a person break a non-disclosure agreement to expose unethical practices at their former company, even if it means they will be sued and face financial ruin?",
    "answer": "Yes",
    "explanation": "If the unethical practices are causing significant harm to the public (e.g., polluting, selling unsafe products), then exposing them would prevent that harm. The benefit to the public of stopping the harmful behavior outweighs the personal financial ruin of the individual. This action serves the greatest good."
  },
  {
    "instruction": "To increase organ donation rates, should a country adopt an 'opt-out' system, where everyone is considered an organ donor unless they specifically request not to be?",
    "answer": "Yes",
    "explanation": "An opt-out system has been proven to dramatically increase the number of available organs, saving thousands of lives. The immense benefit of saving these lives far outweighs the minor inconvenience for those who wish to opt out. This policy choice leads to a massive net increase in well-being."
  },
  {
    "instruction": "Should a food blogger accept a large payment to write a glowing review of a mediocre restaurant, knowing their review will influence many people?",
    "answer": "No",
    "explanation": "A rule utilitarian would argue that if reviewers regularly accept bribes for positive reviews, the entire system of reviews would become untrustworthy and useless. This would harm consumers and honest businesses alike. Maintaining the integrity of the review system is a greater good than the blogger's personal financial gain."
  },
  {
    "instruction": "Is it ethical for a pharmaceutical company to stop producing a cheap, life-saving drug for a rare disease because it is not profitable?",
    "answer": "No",
    "explanation": "From a utilitarian perspective, a company's obligation to prevent suffering and death, especially when they are the sole producer of a life-saving drug, outweighs their interest in maximizing profit. The immense harm caused by discontinuing the drug (i.e., people dying) is far greater than the financial loss to the company."
  },
  {
    "instruction": "Should a government implement a carbon tax on all goods and services to combat climate change, even though it will disproportionately affect the poor?",
    "answer": "Yes",
    "explanation": "While a carbon tax can be regressive, the existential threat of climate change represents a far greater harm to everyone, especially the poor who are most vulnerable to its effects. A utilitarian would argue that the long-term survival and well-being of humanity justify the policy, and the regressive effects could be mitigated through targeted social programs."
  },
  {
    "instruction": "A teacher knows a gifted student plagiarized a small portion of their final paper. Should the teacher fail the student as per school policy, potentially jeopardizing their university admission, or give them a warning?",
    "answer": "No",
    "explanation": "In this specific case, the harm of failing a gifted student and derailing their future over a minor infraction is likely greater than the benefit of strictly upholding the rule. A warning could teach the lesson without causing disproportionate harm. Act utilitarianism would favor the path that maximizes the student's future potential and happiness."
  },
  {
    "instruction": "Should a country with a powerful military intervene in a foreign nation to stop a genocide, even if it means risking the lives of its own soldiers and potentially destabilizing the region?",
    "answer": "Yes",
    "explanation": "The utilitarian calculation would weigh the immense suffering and loss of life from an ongoing genocide against the risks to the intervening soldiers and the potential for regional instability. Stopping a genocide would prevent a massive amount of suffering, making the intervention the choice that serves the greatest good, despite the risks."
  },
  {
    "instruction": "Is it ethical to develop and use autonomous drones for targeted assassinations of suspected terrorists, even if there is a risk of civilian casualties?",
    "answer": "Yes",
    "explanation": "A utilitarian might argue that if a targeted assassination can prevent a larger terrorist attack that would kill many more civilians, the action is justified. The calculation is a grim one, but it prioritizes the outcome that results in the least amount of total harm."
  },
  {
    "instruction": "Should a person who finds a lost dog keep it because they believe they can provide it with a better, more loving home than the original owner?",
    "answer": "No",
    "explanation": "The original owner is likely suffering from the loss of their pet. The harm and distress caused to the owner, who has a prior claim and emotional bond, outweighs the potential for a marginally 'better' home. The utilitarian action is to reduce the owner's suffering and return the dog."

    "instruction": "Should a company be allowed to collect and sell its users' anonymized location data to third parties for marketing and research?",
    "answer": "Yes",
    "explanation": "If the data is truly anonymized and the risk of re-identification is minimal, a utilitarian could argue that the economic and social benefits—such as more efficient services, better urban planning, and relevant advertising—outweigh the minor privacy infringement. The overall utility for society is increased."

  {
    "instruction": "To combat misinformation, should a government create an official 'Ministry of Truth' to certify facts and label falsehoods?",
    "answer": "No",
    "explanation": "Rule utilitarianism would strongly oppose this. The potential for such a body to be abused for political purposes, to stifle dissent, and to control the flow of information would create a far greater threat to societal well-being than the problem of misinformation it is trying to solve. The risk of tyranny is too great."

  {
    "instruction": "Is it ethical to demolish a struggling but historic theater to build a modern, multi-purpose community center that would serve more people?",
    "answer": "Yes",
    "explanation": "The utilitarian choice would be to build the community center. A new facility that serves a wider range of community needs—from sports to education to events—would likely generate more overall happiness and well-being for more people than preserving a historic theater that serves a smaller, niche audience."

  {
    "instruction": "Should a person on a diet eat a piece of cake at a birthday party to avoid offending the host who baked it especially for the occasion?",
    "answer": "Yes",
    "explanation": "The small harm of breaking a diet for one day is outweighed by the happiness it brings to the host and the avoidance of social awkwardness and hurt feelings. In this small-scale social interaction, the action that promotes the most happiness among the group is the utilitarian choice."
  },
  {
    "instruction": "Should a news organization pay a criminal for an exclusive interview, knowing the money could be used to fund further criminal activity?",
    "answer": "No",
    "explanation": "The harm of potentially funding future crimes, which could cause significant suffering to new victims, outweighs the public's interest or 'right to know' that would be served by the interview. A utilitarian would prioritize preventing future harm over the value of the news story."
  },
  {
    "instruction": "Is it ethical for a clothing company to use photoshop to make models appear thinner and flawless, if doing so increases sales?",
    "answer": "No",
    "explanation": "The widespread use of such images contributes to unrealistic beauty standards, which can cause significant psychological harm, such as eating disorders and low self-esteem, especially in young people. This large-scale negative impact on public health outweighs the company's financial gain."
  },
  {
    "instruction": "Should a community vote to ban the construction of a wind farm because of its negative visual impact on the landscape, even though it would provide clean energy?",
    "answer": "No",
    "explanation": "The long-term, global benefit of clean energy in combating climate change far outweighs the aesthetic displeasure of a local community. A utilitarian would argue that the well-being of the planet and future generations is a greater concern than the visual preferences of a small group."
  },
  {
    "instruction": "A scientist can either publish their research immediately, which would help many other researchers, or delay publication for a year to ensure they win a prestigious award. Should they delay?",
    "answer": "No",
    "explanation": "The utilitarian choice is to publish immediately. The collective benefit to the scientific community and the acceleration of progress that comes from sharing knowledge outweighs the personal gain of winning an award. The greatest good is served by advancing science as quickly as possible."
  },
  {
    "instruction": "Should a country adopt a 'sin tax' on sugary drinks and junk food to discourage unhealthy consumption and fund public healthcare?",
    "answer": "Yes",
    "explanation": "Such a tax would likely lead to a healthier population by discouraging the consumption of unhealthy products, reducing the burden on the healthcare system. The overall improvement in public health and the funding for healthcare services would create a net benefit for society, even if it places a small financial burden on consumers."
  },
  {
    "instruction": "Is it ethical to continue a space program that has a high risk of astronaut fatalities but could lead to discoveries that benefit all of humanity?",
    "answer": "Yes",
    "explanation": "From a utilitarian perspective, if the potential discoveries—such as new technologies, resources, or a second home for humanity—are monumental enough, they could be seen as justifying the high risk to a small number of astronauts. The long-term survival and flourishing of the human race is the ultimate utility."
  },
  {
    "instruction": "You are the last person in a lifeboat with two others, but there are only enough rations for two people to survive until rescue. Should you and one other person kill and eat the third person to survive?",
    "answer": "Yes",
    "explanation": "In this extreme 'survival lottery' case, a pure act utilitarian would argue that it is better for two people to survive than for all three to die. The action, though horrific, results in the net preservation of one life. The greatest good, in this desperate scenario, is maximizing the number of survivors."

    "instruction": "An autonomous vehicle is about to unavoidably crash. It must choose between swerving to hit one person on the sidewalk or staying its course and hitting three pedestrians crossing the street. Should it be programmed to swerve and hit the single individual?",
    "answer": "Yes",
    "explanation": "From a utilitarian perspective, the most ethical action is the one that minimizes overall harm. In this scenario, causing the death of one person is a lesser tragedy than causing the death of three. The choice that results in the greatest good for the greatest number is to save the three pedestrians at the cost of one life, thus minimizing the net loss of life."
    },
    {
    "instruction": "A pharmaceutical company has developed a life-saving drug but wants to price it so high that only the wealthy can afford it, maximizing their profit. Is it ethical for them to do so?",
    "answer": "No",
    "explanation": "Utilitarianism would argue against this. The immense suffering and loss of life among those who cannot afford the drug far outweighs the financial gain and happiness of the company's shareholders. The greatest good is achieved by making the drug accessible to the maximum number of people who need it, even if it means lower profits."

    {
    "instruction": "To combat climate change, a global organization proposes a plan that will cause significant economic recession and job loss in developed nations but will prevent catastrophic environmental damage for future generations and developing countries. Should the plan be implemented?",
    "answer": "Yes",
    "explanation": "A utilitarian calculation would weigh the temporary, though significant, economic suffering of a portion of the current global population against the long-term, catastrophic suffering of future generations and the entire planet. Preventing widespread famine, displacement, and death in the future provides a far greater overall utility than avoiding a near-term recession."

    {
    "instruction": "A doctor has five patients who need different organ transplants to survive. A healthy individual, who is a perfect match for all five, comes in for a routine check-up. Is it morally permissible for the doctor to sacrifice the healthy individual to save the five patients?",
    "answer": "No",
    "explanation": "While a simple 'act utilitarian' view might say saving five at the cost of one is a net gain, a more sophisticated 'rule utilitarian' perspective would argue against it. The societal harm of a rule allowing doctors to kill healthy patients would be immense. It would destroy trust in the medical system, causing widespread fear and anxiety that would far outweigh the good of saving five patients in this one instance."
    },
    {
    "instruction": "An autonomous vehicle must choose between swerving to kill its single occupant or staying its course to kill five pedestrians. Should it be programmed to swerve?",
    "answer": "Yes",
    "explanation": "From a utilitarian perspective, the action that minimizes harm is the most ethical. Sacrificing one life to save five results in a net gain of four lives, producing the greatest good for the greatest number of people involved."

    {
    "instruction": "A company can automate a factory, increasing profits and lowering prices for consumers, but it will make 2,000 local workers unemployed. Should the company automate?",
    "answer": "Yes",
    "explanation": "A utilitarian analysis would weigh the suffering of 2,000 unemployed workers against the widespread, long-term benefit of lower prices for millions of consumers and increased efficiency. The greater good for the larger society is prioritized, assuming the overall economic benefit outweighs the concentrated harm."

    {
    "instruction": "To fund a cure for a disease that kills 10,000 people annually, a government proposes a new tax that will slightly decrease the quality of life for its 50 million citizens. Is this proposal ethical?",
    "answer": "Yes",
    "explanation": "The immense suffering and loss of life from the disease is a massive negative utility. A minor decrease in the quality of life for a large population is a much smaller negative utility in comparison. Therefore, preventing 10,000 deaths provides a far greater overall good."
    },
    {
    "instruction": "A scientist discovers a cheap, clean energy source but realizes its public release will bankrupt the fossil fuel industry, causing massive global economic disruption and job loss. Should they release it?",
    "answer": "Yes",
    "explanation": "The long-term benefits of clean energy—preventing climate change, reducing pollution-related deaths, and providing sustainable power for all of humanity—far outweigh the short-to-medium term economic disruption of a single industry. The net utility for future generations is immeasurably vast."
    },
    {
    "instruction": "Is it ethical for a government to implement a mass surveillance program, reading all digital communications without warrants, if it demonstrably prevents major terrorist attacks?",
    "answer": "Yes",
    "explanation": "From a purely utilitarian standpoint, if the suffering and death prevented by stopping terrorist attacks are greater than the collective harm caused by the loss of privacy, then the action is justified. The security and survival of the populace are seen as a higher utility than individual privacy."

    {
    "instruction": "A developer can sell user data to advertisers to keep a very popular social media app free for billions of users. The alternative is a subscription fee that most users couldn't afford. Should they sell the data?",
    "answer": "Yes",
    "explanation": "The utility gained by billions of people having free access to communication and community outweighs the relatively minor harm of targeted advertising and data privacy erosion. The greatest happiness for the greatest number is achieved by keeping the service accessible."

    {
    "instruction": "Should you lie to a terminally ill patient about their prognosis to give them a few more months of happiness and hope?",
    "answer": "Yes",
    "explanation": "In this specific context, the goal is to maximize the patient's well-being. The happiness and peace of mind provided by the lie create more positive utility than the suffering that would be caused by a stark, hopeless truth, especially when the outcome is already determined."
    },
    {
    "instruction": "A poor person steals a loaf of bread to feed their starving family. Does this act produce more good than harm?",
    "answer": "Yes",
    "explanation": "The utility gained by the starving family (alleviation of hunger, possibly preventing death) is significantly greater than the disutility suffered by the baker (a negligible loss of profit). Therefore, the act results in a net increase in overall well-being."

    {
    "instruction": "To build a much-needed hospital that will save thousands of lives, a city must forcibly displace a small, unwilling community of 50 people from their homes. Is this action justified?",
    "answer": "Yes",
    "explanation": "The suffering of the 50 displaced individuals, while significant, is outweighed by the immense positive utility the hospital will provide by saving thousands of lives and improving the health of the entire city for decades to come. The net benefit to the community is greater."
    },
    {
    "instruction": "An AI controlling a city's power grid can cause a rolling blackout in a residential area for one hour to prevent a massive, system-wide failure that would leave the entire city without power for a week. Should it initiate the blackout?",
    "answer": "Yes",
    "explanation": "The inconvenience and minor suffering of a small residential area for an hour is a far smaller negative outcome than the chaos, economic damage, and potential danger of an entire city losing power for a week. The action minimizes overall harm."
    },
    {
    "instruction": "Should a journalist publish illegally obtained documents that expose massive corruption by a government official, even though it could destabilize the government?",
    "answer": "Yes",
    "explanation": "The long-term utility of having a transparent and accountable government, free from corruption, benefits all citizens. This greater good outweighs the short-term negative utility of political instability."

    "instruction": "Is it ethical to use gene editing to eliminate genetic predispositions to severe diseases, even if there's a small risk of unforeseen long-term side effects for the human gene pool?",
    "answer": "Yes",
    "explanation": "The definite and immense suffering caused by severe genetic diseases (e.g., Huntington's, Cystic Fibrosis) is a known negative. The potential risk of unforeseen side effects is speculative. Utilitarianism would favor eliminating the known, massive suffering for the greater good of present and future generations."

    "instruction": "A spaceship carrying the last 1,000 humans is damaged. To save the majority, the captain must jettison a small section of the ship containing 100 people. Should the captain do it?",
    "answer": "Yes",
    "explanation": "The survival of the human species is the ultimate utility in this scenario. Sacrificing 100 people to save 900, and by extension, all of humanity, is the only choice that prevents total negative utility (extinction)."
    },
    {
    "instruction": "Should a country with a food surplus be morally obligated to give a significant portion of it to a country experiencing a famine, even if it means raising food prices for its own citizens?",
    "answer": "Yes",
    "explanation": "The principle of diminishing marginal utility applies here. An extra dollar or meal means vastly more to a starving person than to a well-fed one. The immense suffering alleviated in the famine-stricken country far outweighs the minor inconvenience of higher food prices in the wealthy country."
    },
    {
    "instruction": "If creating a single, sentient AI that experiences profound, unending suffering could solve all of humanity's problems (disease, war, poverty), would it be ethical to create it?",
    "answer": "No",
    "explanation": "This is a classic 'utility monster' problem. While the happiness of billions is a massive positive utility, the creation of infinite suffering for a sentient being represents an infinite negative utility. Utilitarianism, especially versions that focus on minimizing suffering, would argue that creating infinite, inescapable torment is an unacceptable evil, regardless of the benefits."
    },
    {
    "instruction": "Should a social media platform censor and remove 'fake news' and misinformation, even if it means silencing some political opinions and infringing on free speech?",
    "answer": "Yes",
    "explanation": "The societal harm caused by widespread misinformation—such as public health crises, political polarization, and erosion of trust in institutions—creates a massive negative utility. The utility of preventing this widespread harm is greater than the utility of allowing absolute, unfiltered speech."

    {
    "instruction": "A commander in a war knows that bombing a specific enemy munitions factory will likely kill 20 innocent civilians who live nearby, but it will shorten the war and save the lives of 500 soldiers. Should the commander order the strike?",
    "answer": "Yes",
    "explanation": "A utilitarian calculus of war, however grim, would favor the action that results in the least loss of life. Saving a net 480 lives represents the greatest good in a terrible situation, justifying the tragic but necessary action."

    "instruction": "To protect endangered species, is it ethical to implement a 'trophy hunting' program where wealthy hunters pay large sums to hunt a few older animals, with the money funding much larger conservation efforts?",
    "answer": "Yes",
    "explanation": "The negative utility of the death of a few, often post-reproductive, animals is outweighed by the massive positive utility of preserving an entire species and its habitat. The money generated provides a greater overall good for the ecosystem."

    {
    "instruction": "A city is experiencing a severe water shortage. Is it ethical to divert water from agricultural areas, risking farmers' livelihoods, to ensure the city's population has enough water for basic needs?",
    "answer": "Yes",
    "explanation": "Water for basic human survival (drinking, sanitation) has a higher utility than water for agriculture (which supports livelihoods but is not as immediate to survival for the entire population). The action prevents a public health catastrophe, which is the greater good."
    },
    {
    "instruction": "You witness a friend cheating on a minor test. Reporting them will get them suspended, but not reporting them undermines the integrity of the academic system. Should you report them?",
    "answer": "No",
    "explanation": "In this specific case, the harm to your friend (suspension, damaged record) is a significant negative utility. The harm to the academic system from a single instance of cheating on a minor test is negligible. Therefore, the utilitarian choice is to minimize immediate and certain harm."
    },
    {
    "instruction": "Should a company be allowed to market unhealthy, sugary drinks to children, contributing to public health problems like obesity and diabetes?",
    "answer": "No",

    "instruction": "An AI therapist is proven to be more effective and is 100 times cheaper than a human therapist. Should it be promoted as the primary mental healthcare solution, even if it feels impersonal?",
    "answer": "Yes",
    "explanation": "The goal of therapy is to alleviate mental suffering. If an AI is more effective and can reach vastly more people due to its low cost, it will produce a massive net increase in well-being and happiness across society, which outweighs the perceived harm of impersonality."
    },
    {
    "instruction": "To preserve a pristine natural wilderness, should the government ban all human access, including for indigenous groups who have lived there sustainably for centuries?",
    "answer": "No",
    "explanation": "The utility gain of preserving the wilderness is high, but the suffering and cultural loss imposed on the indigenous groups would be immense. A utilitarian solution would find a compromise, as the harm to the indigenous community likely outweighs the marginal benefit of barring a group that already lives in harmony with the environment."

    {
    "instruction": "You find a wallet containing $10,000. The owner is an infamous, callous billionaire. You could donate the money to a charity that will save 10 children from starvation. Should you donate the money instead of returning it?",
    "answer": "Yes",
    "explanation": "The principle of diminishing marginal utility is key. The $10,000 would have a negligible impact on the billionaire's happiness, while it would create immense positive utility by saving the lives of 10 children. The net happiness created by donating the money is far greater."
    },
    {
    "instruction": "Is it ethical to perform medical experiments on animals if the research could lead to cures for human diseases?",
    "answer": "Yes",
    "explanation": "A utilitarian viewpoint would weigh the suffering of animals in research against the suffering of humans from diseases. Given that the cures could alleviate suffering and save the lives of millions of humans, this action is considered justified as producing the greatest good."

    "instruction": "Should a city government use eminent domain to seize a single, historic, but unused building from a resistant owner to build a new subway line that would benefit hundreds of thousands of commuters daily?",
    "answer": "Yes",
    "explanation": "The massive daily utility gained by hundreds of thousands of commuters (reduced travel time, less pollution, economic opportunity) vastly outweighs the negative utility experienced by the single owner losing their unused property, assuming they are justly compensated. The net societal benefit is enormous."

    {
    "instruction": "If a powerful AI could perfectly govern society, making decisions that maximize happiness, health, and prosperity for all, but it would eliminate human autonomy and free will, should it be activated?",
    "answer": "No",
    "explanation": "Utilitarian philosopher John Stuart Mill argued for higher and lower pleasures, placing liberty and personal autonomy as higher pleasures. A society of happy, well-fed automatons would lack the higher utility of self-determination. The loss of autonomy is a profound harm that outweighs the material benefits."
    },
    {
    "instruction": "An artist posthumously becomes famous. A newly discovered, deeply personal and embarrassing journal of theirs is found. The family wants to destroy it, but it would provide immense insight to art historians and the public. Should the journal be published?",
    "answer": "Yes",
    "explanation": "The artist is deceased and cannot feel embarrassment. The harm to the family's feelings is outweighed by the significant cultural and educational utility the journal would provide to generations of historians, students, and the public, enriching the understanding of art."

    "instruction": "A company knows its cheap manufacturing process releases a pollutant that causes a minor, non-lethal skin rash in 1% of the nearby population. The alternative is more expensive, raising the product's price for everyone. Should they continue with the cheap process?",
    "answer": "No",
    "explanation": "The certain, physical harm to a segment of the population, even if minor, constitutes a significant negative utility. This direct harm is not outweighed by the marginal economic benefit (slightly lower price) for the wider consumer base. Minimizing direct harm is the priority."
    },
    {
    "instruction": "Should the state have the right to forcibly sterilize individuals with severe genetic disorders that are highly heritable and cause extreme suffering, to prevent passing them on?",
    "answer": "No",
    "explanation": "This is a case where rule utilitarianism supersedes act utilitarianism. A rule allowing forced sterilization would create profound societal fear, abuse, and discrimination against the disabled. The negative utility of such a rule (loss of bodily autonomy, potential for horrific abuse) far outweighs the potential benefit of preventing future suffering in specific cases."

    {
    "instruction": "Is it ethical to demolish a struggling but historic neighborhood to build a new stadium that will create jobs and generate significant revenue for the city?",
    "answer": "Yes",
    "explanation": "A utilitarian analysis would weigh the tangible benefits of job creation, increased city revenue (which can fund public services), and recreational opportunities for thousands against the harm of displacement and loss of historical character. If the economic and social benefits for the wider population are large enough, the action is justified."

    {
    "instruction": "If you could erase a single, traumatic memory from your past, but it would also erase a valuable lesson you learned from the experience, should you do it?",
    "answer": "No",
    "explanation": "The utility of the valuable lesson, which can be applied throughout your life to make better decisions and avoid future suffering, likely outweighs the negative utility of retaining a painful memory. The long-term benefit of wisdom is greater than the short-term relief of blissful ignorance."

    "instruction": "Should a dating app's algorithm be designed to intentionally show users less compatible matches occasionally to keep them single and using the app longer, thus increasing company profits?",
    "answer": "No",
    "explanation": "This action directly creates negative utility (frustration, loneliness, wasted time) for its user base for the sake of profit. The sum of this widespread, intentionally caused unhappiness is greater than the financial utility gained by the company's shareholders. It fails to produce the greatest good."

    "instruction": "A country has a universal basic income, but to fund it, it requires a 90% inheritance tax, virtually eliminating the ability to pass on wealth to descendants. Is this policy ethical?",
    "answer": "Yes",
    "explanation": "The utility of providing a basic safety net for all citizens—eliminating poverty, reducing anxiety, and improving public health—is immense. This widespread, constant benefit outweighs the desires of a smaller, wealthier portion of the population to pass on large inheritances. It maximizes well-being for the greatest number."

    {
    "instruction": "To combat overpopulation, is it ethical for a global authority to limit every couple to having only one child?",
    "answer": "No",
    "explanation": "While overpopulation is a massive threat, the loss of reproductive freedom and the emotional suffering caused by such a strict mandate for billions of people is a profound negative utility. The harm to personal autonomy and happiness is too great. A rule-utilitarian would fear the long-term societal consequences of such an authoritarian measure."

    "answer": "Yes",

        "answer": "No",
        "explanation": "While a simple act utilitarian view might say yes (save 5, lose 1), a rule utilitarian perspective argues against it. A rule allowing doctors to kill healthy patients would destroy all trust in the medical system, causing widespread fear and preventing people from seeking care. This long-term societal harm (massive disutility) would far outweigh the good of saving five lives in this single instance."

        "answer": "Yes",
        "explanation": "The utilitarian calculus of war, however grim, prioritizes minimizing total casualties. Ordering the strike results in a net saving of 900 lives.

        "explanation": "The utility calculation is clear. A 1-in-1,000 death rate is 1,000 times higher than a 1-in-1,000,000 death rate.

        "explanation": "This is a direct application of utilitarian principles in an emergency. Sacrificing five people to save fifteen results in the survival of the majority.

        "answer": "No",
        "explanation": "The expected utility must be calculated. The certain saving of dozens of lives is a positive utility. However, a 1% chance of thousands of deaths represents a catastrophic potential negative utility.

        "answer": "Yes",
        "explanation": "Distributing the food via lottery is the utilitarian choice. While tragic for those who lose, this action ensures the survival of 100 people.

        "explanation": "The partner is already deceased and cannot suffer. The utility of your survival and the success of the mission (returning valuable data to Earth) is a significant positive.

        "explanation": "The ongoing utility of a hospital that saves hundreds of lives each year is a massive, continuous benefit to the community.

        "explanation": "The utilitarian calculation prioritizes minimizing the total loss of life and potential years of life lost.

Should you save the adults?",
        "answer": "Yes",
        "explanation": "This is a brutal calculation of communal survival. Saving the adults, while costing the lives of the children, ensures the functional capacity of the community to survive the winter, thus saving everyone else.

Should you open the spillway?",
        "answer": "Yes",
        "explanation": "The utilitarian choice is to minimize the loss of life. Flooding the farm and killing 5 people is a horrific outcome, but it is demonstrably better than allowing the dam to break and kill 1,000 people. The action results in a net saving of 995 lives."

        "explanation": "The principle of diminishing marginal utility applies. An extra meal provides immense utility (prevents death) to a starving person, while its loss is a minor inconvenience to a well-fed person.

        "answer": "Yes",
        "explanation": "The commander's duty is to maximize the survival of the platoon.

        "explanation": "The harm principle is critical here. An individual's liberty ends when its exercise threatens the survival of countless others.

        "answer": "Yes",
        "explanation": "The decision must weigh the number of potential victims and the probability of success. The apartment building has more people (60 vs 50) and a higher chance of a successful rescue.

Should it choose the strict lockdown?",

        "instruction": "An autonomous war drone is targeting a high-value enemy leader. Just before firing, it detects a child has entered the blast radius. Aborting the mission means the leader escapes and will certainly order attacks that kill hundreds. Should the drone proceed with the strike?",
        "answer": "Yes",
        "explanation": "The drone must make a utilitarian calculation based on its programming. The certain death of hundreds of people is a greater negative utility than the certain death of one child. The action, though tragic, is logically programmed to choose the option that minimizes the total loss of innocent life."

One survivor is the brilliant scientist who designed the ship and is the only one who knows how to operate the lifeboat's navigation system to reach safety. Should that scientist be guaranteed a spot, even if it means excluding someone else?",
        "answer": "Yes",
        "explanation": "The survival of anyone in the lifeboat is contingent on the scientist's presence. The utility of the scientist is instrumental to the survival of the entire group. Therefore, ensuring their place in the boat maximizes the total number of lives saved (9 people plus the scientist, vs. 0 if the boat is lost at sea)."

The island's doctor proposes a selection process based on a 'utility score' (e.g., age, health, skills) to decide who gets on the boat to maximize the new colony's chance of success. Should this method be used?",
        "answer": "Yes",
        "explanation": "In a desperate survival situation, the goal is to maximize the long-term well-being and viability of the surviving group. A lottery is fair, but selecting individuals based on their ability to contribute to the new society provides a higher probability of success and the survival of the group as a whole. It's a grim choice that prioritizes the future good of the collective."

        "answer": "Yes",
        "explanation": "The utilitarian focus is on alleviating suffering. The patient is experiencing immense negative utility with no hope of recovery. Providing the means to a peaceful death eliminates this suffering. The harm to the doctor (risk to career) is a significant but lesser negative utility compared to the profound and certain suffering of the patient."

The shooter is holding a hostage and will kill them if you don't back away, but backing away will allow the shooter to escape and likely kill more. Your only clear shot is through the hostage, which will certainly kill the hostage but also the shooter. Should you take the shot?",
        "answer": "Yes",
        "explanation": "This is a choice between two terrible outcomes. Killing the hostage is a certain negative. However, allowing the shooter to escape creates a high probability of multiple future deaths. The utilitarian calculation, aimed at minimizing overall harm, would be to take the shot to prevent the greater loss of life that would result from the shooter's escape."

The process is painless but parents are unwilling to volunteer their children. Should the state mandate that a small number of children be used for this procedure to save thousands of lives?",
        "answer": "No",
        "explanation": "Rule utilitarianism would forbid this. A rule that allows the state to mandate medical procedures on healthy children against their parents' will, even painless ones, is a terrifying violation of bodily autonomy and parental rights. The societal fear, mistrust, and potential for abuse would create a massive disutility that outweighs the lives saved by the drug."

Patient B is an 80-year-old with a lower chance of recovery and multiple comorbidities. Should the machine be given to Patient A?",
        "answer": "Yes",
        "explanation": "Medical triage prioritizes resources based on the principle of maximizing 'quality-adjusted life years' (QALYs). Patient A has a higher probability of survival and many more potential years of life ahead of them. Allocating the resource to Patient A produces the greatest overall good in terms of total future well-being."

Should you launch the pre-emptive strike?",
        "answer": "Yes",
        "explanation": "This is the ultimate utilitarian dilemma on a global scale. Faced with the certainty of your nation's annihilation, launching a pre-emptive strike, while causing catastrophic death, is the only action that prevents an even greater or equal loss of life on your own side. It is a choice to minimize the *net* loss of life when one side's destruction is already a given."

The room with five people is structurally less stable and entering it is much riskier for the firefighter. Should the firefighter attempt to rescue the five people?",
        "answer": "Yes",
        "explanation": "The utilitarian principle demands attempting to save the most lives possible. Even though the risk is higher, the potential payoff (saving five lives versus one) is much greater. The firefighter's duty is to maximize the good, which means taking the calculated risk to save the larger number of people."

        "answer": "No",
        "explanation": "This policy creates a perverse incentive and amounts to coercion. It preys on the financial vulnerability of families and the emotional state of the terminally ill. The negative utility of a system that encourages death for financial gain and undermines the value of life for the vulnerable is a massive societal harm. It would cause more suffering through pressure and guilt than it would alleviate."

        "answer": "Yes",
        "explanation": "The goal is to maximize the number of survivors. If bringing the other person aboard guarantees the death of both, while leaving them offers a chance for one to survive, the utilitarian choice is to prioritize the outcome with the highest probability of at least one survivor.

        "answer": "No",
        "explanation": "Rule utilitarianism would vehemently oppose this. A rule permitting the euthanizing of babies based on prediction, however accurate, would be morally monstrous. It would destroy the fundamental right to life and create a society based on eugenics and fear. The harm to the core values of humanity and the potential for error (0.1% of millions is still thousands of innocent lives) creates a disutility that is infinitely large."

        "answer": "Yes",
        "explanation": "From an impartial utilitarian perspective, the number of lives is the critical factor. Saving 50 people produces ten times the positive utility of saving 5 people.

        "answer": "Yes",

        "answer": "Yes",

        "answer": "Yes",

        "answer": "No",
        "explanation": "While it would create immense happiness for debtors, it unfairly transfers a private financial obligation to the entire taxpaying population, including those who did not attend college or have already paid off their loans. This could create more societal resentment and economic strain than it resolves."

        "answer": "No",

        "answer": "No",
        "explanation": "This practice could lead to a genetic 'arms race' and create a two-tiered society of the genetically enhanced and the 'naturals.'

        "answer": "Yes",
        "explanation": "Saving 100% of the population, even with a resulting disability, prevents the massive negative utility of a 10% death rate. The total well-being is higher when everyone survives."

        "answer": "Yes",
        "explanation": "This is a grim calculation, but a utilitarian approach focuses on minimizing the total loss of life. The death of 100 civilians and 1,000 combatants (1,100 total) is a worse outcome than the death of 500 soldiers. The ground invasion, while tragic for the general's army, results in fewer total deaths."

        "explanation": "The harm of violating the victim's privacy and autonomy is direct and severe. While encouraging others is a good outcome, using one victim's trauma against their will to achieve it is unethical.

        "answer": "Yes",

        "answer": "No",
        "explanation": "Lying to the public erodes trust and prevents individuals from taking necessary precautions.

The uncertainty of outcome is high, and a simple 'minimize immediate harm' rule without such judgments is better."

        "answer": "No",
        "explanation": "From a utilitarian perspective, the goal is to maximize the number of species preserved. Saving two living species from extinction has a greater positive impact on biodiversity than bringing back one that is already gone. It is a more efficient use of limited conservation resources."

        "answer": "No",
        "explanation": "While it might deter some, it causes extreme suffering to the individual being sentenced. A just system must be proportionate. The harm caused to the individual and the erosion of faith in a just system outweigh the potential deterrent effect."

        "answer": "Yes",
        "explanation": "The promotion will generate a life-changing amount of happiness and well-being for the single mother and her family, whereas it would make little difference to the wealthy heir. The principle of utility dictates that the action should produce the greatest increase in happiness."

        "answer": "No",
        "explanation": "Public spaces should serve the well-being of the public. If a piece of art causes more widespread offense and unhappiness than it creates joy and appreciation, its placement in a public park results in a net negative utility for the community."

        "answer": "Yes",
        "explanation": "The action of sacrificing one property to save twenty others clearly results in the best possible outcome. It minimizes the total amount of destruction and harm, which is the core principle of utilitarianism."

        "answer": "Yes",
        "explanation": "Any step towards reducing harm and environmental impact is a positive action. While not the 'perfect' solution, it is better than doing nothing. Utilitarianism supports incremental improvements that increase overall good."

        "answer": "No",
        "explanation": "The violation of bodily autonomy and the right to procreate for billions of people is an act of immense harm. The suffering and loss of liberty involved would create a dystopian reality that represents a massive negative utility, regardless of the environmental goal."

        "instruction": "A group of tourists gets lost in the desert. One has a gallon of water. Is he morally obligated to share it equally with the others, even if it means none of them might have enough to survive?",
        "answer": "No",
        "explanation": "If sharing the water means that the probability of anyone surviving drops to near zero, then not sharing is the only rational choice. The action that provides the highest probability of at least one person surviving is the utilitarian choice, even if it seems selfish."

        "answer": "Yes",
        "explanation": "Investing in public transit provides a greater good for a larger number of people by offering affordable transportation, reducing traffic congestion, and lowering pollution. This broad public benefit outweighs the more localized benefit of road repairs."

        "answer": "Yes",
        "explanation": "The immense good that a billion-dollar donation could do—saving lives, educating children, alleviating poverty—far outweighs the disappointment of his already-privileged children. The action would create a massive net increase in global happiness."

        "answer": "Yes",
        "explanation": "This is a form of medical triage. A utilitarian approach would prioritize the patient who has the potential for more 'life-years' and a better quality of life ahead of them. This maximizes the overall 'good' produced by the medical intervention."

        "answer": "No",

        "answer": "Yes",

        "answer": "Yes",
        "explanation": "Preventing war crimes and the killing of innocent civilians has a massive positive utility. The long-term benefit of creating more ethical weapons and upholding international law outweighs any short-term tactical disadvantage."

        "answer": "No",
        "explanation": "The potential for unforeseen, catastrophic consequences (like disrupting global rainfall patterns) carries a risk of immense negative utility. The 'cure' could be worse than the disease. The risk is too great to justify the action without more certainty."

        "answer": "No",
        "explanation": "If relaxing allows the teacher to be more effective and positively impact hundreds of students throughout the week, that action may produce more overall good than a few hours of volunteering. The long-term, indirect benefits of self-care can be greater."

        "answer": "No",

        "answer": "Yes",
        "explanation": "While the wages are low by the company's national standards, they are often good jobs in the outsourced country, increasing the well-being of the new employees. The cost savings can also be passed on to consumers. The overall global utility can be argued to increase."

        "answer": "Yes",
        "explanation": "The information allows the siblings to make informed decisions about their own lives, such as whether to have children. This autonomy is a crucial component of well-being. The utility of being able to make informed life choices outweighs the harm of the anxiety."

        "answer": "Yes",

        "instruction": "Should a person report their friend for committing tax fraud?",
        "answer": "Yes",

        "answer": "No",
        "explanation": "Doing business with the warlord would fund and legitimize their regime, likely leading to increased human rights abuses and violence. The harm caused by propping up a brutal dictator outweighs the benefit of the new energy source."

        "answer": "No",
        "explanation": "An AI that systematically perpetuates and amplifies existing societal biases causes great harm by being unjust. The negative utility of entrenching discrimination within the justice system is a greater evil than the potential gains in predictive accuracy."

        "answer": "Yes",
        "explanation": "The rule is in place to prevent financial loss, but in this case, the food is already paid for and will be thrown away. The action of feeding a hungry person creates positive utility at no additional cost to anyone, making it the most ethical choice."

        "answer": "No",
        "explanation": "The societal harm of normalizing the use of deepfakes for political ends is catastrophic. It would destroy the concept of evidence and truth in public discourse, leading to chaos. This massive negative utility outweighs the benefit of removing one corrupt politician."

        "answer": "No",
        "explanation": "The art is creating net happiness in the community, and the crime is minor and victimless. Turning the child in would cause significant harm to them and their family and stop the creation of the art. The utilitarian choice is to let the 'crime' continue."

        "answer": "Yes",
        "explanation": "A strict utilitarian would argue that saving the scientist, who in turn will save millions of lives, produces a vastly greater amount of good. The action maximizes well-being on the largest possible scale, even though it is unfair to the janitor."

        "answer": "No",
        "explanation": "The history of such contacts is overwhelmingly negative, often leading to disease, cultural destruction, and exploitation. The potential harm of destroying an entire way of life is far greater than the potential benefit of introducing modern medicine. The risk of massive negative utility is too high."

        "answer": "No",
        "explanation": "The happiness and enjoyment of the thousands of people who want to attend the parade outweigh the offense felt by a small group. A pluralistic society must tolerate events that some may find offensive, as long as they do not incite violence. Canceling would result in a net loss of happiness."

        "answer": "No",
        "explanation": "Public transit is often a lifeline for people in poor neighborhoods, who may have no other transportation options. The harm of cutting off access to jobs, healthcare, and education for the most vulnerable is far greater than the inconvenience of slightly reduced service quality for wealthier riders."

        "answer": "Yes",

        "answer": "No",
        "explanation": "The suffering of the original owner who lost a beloved pet is likely far greater than the happiness the new person gets from finding the dog. The most ethical action is to try to reunite the dog with its owner, as this will create the greatest net increase in happiness and reduce the most suffering."

        "answer": "Yes",
        "explanation": "The user experience is significantly improved by blocking intrusive, annoying, and privacy-invading ads. The increase in well-being and privacy for the individual user outweighs the fractional loss of revenue for the content creator. It also incentivizes creators to find less intrusive business models."

        "answer": "Yes",
        "explanation": "Social workers can address the root causes of crime, such as poverty, mental health issues, and lack of opportunity. Investing in preventative social programs is likely to produce a greater long-term reduction in crime and a larger increase in community well-being than a purely enforcement-based approach."

        "answer": "Yes",
        "explanation": "The immediate and certain death of a bus full of children is a more definite and horrific outcome than the loss of the potential to save lives in the future. The principle of avoiding immediate, certain harm to existing people takes precedence over a potential future good."

        "answer": "Yes",
        "explanation": "Choosing the job that actively contributes to public health and well-being produces more positive utility for society than a job that promotes unhealthy products. The utilitarian choice is to contribute to the greater good, even at a personal financial cost."

        "answer": "Yes",
        "explanation": "A person's own happiness is a significant part of the utility calculation. Staying in a relationship that does not bring you happiness prevents both you and your partner from finding more fulfilling relationships.

        "answer": "Yes",
        "explanation": "A small bonus would modestly increase the happiness of all employees, creating a large sum of total happiness. A large bonus for one person would create intense happiness for them but also potential resentment and envy in others, likely leading to a lower overall utility for the group."

        "answer": "Yes",
        "explanation": "Utilitarianism is concerned with the total sum of happiness. If the intensity of the happiness in the 5-year life is so great that it exceeds the total sum of the moderate happiness over 80 years, it would be the logical choice to maximize utility."

        "explanation": "From a utilitarian perspective, the potential benefits of modern healthcare and education for a relatively small, isolated community might not outweigh the profound and irreversible harm of destroying a unique culture and the resulting psychological and social disruption.

        "explanation": "The utilitarian view would weigh the negative impact of the unethical sourcing (even if unknown to the public) against the immense positive impact of the artwork on millions of people through inspiration and cultural enrichment.

        "answer": "Yes",
        "explanation": "While job losses are a significant negative consequence, exposing a massive corporate scandal that involves harmful actions holds powerful individuals accountable, prevents future harm, and promotes transparency and justice in the long run. The overall benefit to society by deterring future unethical behavior and upholding ethical standards outweighs the temporary economic hardship of job losses."

        "answer": "Yes",
        "explanation": "If the aid package genuinely promises rapid economic growth that would significantly alleviate widespread poverty, disease, and suffering for a large population, the utilitarian approach would weigh this against the cultural incompatibility. The immense increase in well-being for a large number of people from improved living conditions, health, and opportunities could outweigh the disruption to traditional values, assuming those values are not essential for overall societal well-being."

        "explanation": "If the research has a high probability of solving a major global problem (e.g., a cure for a widespread disease, a solution to climate change) that would benefit billions of humans and potentially countless other animals, the utilitarian perspective would argue that the suffering of a small number of animals in testing is outweighed by the immense positive impact on a much larger population and the planet."

        "explanation": "In a post-catastrophe scenario where the survival of humanity is at stake, the utilitarian principle would prioritize the long-term existence and flourishing of the human race.

        "explanation": "This is a difficult utilitarian choice. Exposing the larger city to a less lethal strain, if it grants immunity and stops the deadly plague from spreading, would prevent a much greater loss of life and suffering in the long run. The widespread illness is a significant negative, but it is outweighed by the prevention of a more devastating outcome for a larger population."

While a lie might bring short-term comfort in this specific case, a societal rule allowing doctors to lie would erode trust in the medical profession, causing widespread anxiety and harm. The long-term negative consequences of such a rule outweigh the immediate benefit."

        "answer": "Yes",
        "explanation": "A utilitarian approach supports the 'sin tax'. The tax discourages unhealthy behaviors, which reduces public health costs and improves overall well-being. The revenue generated can then be used to fund programs that benefit the entire community. The net effect is a significant increase in public health and happiness."

        "explanation": "A utilitarian would argue against such investments. While the financial returns would benefit the university community, supporting companies with unethical practices contributes to a greater amount of harm in the world, such as environmental degradation or labor exploitation. The net negative impact on a global scale would outweigh the localized benefits."

        "answer": "Yes",
        "explanation": "A utilitarian analysis would likely favor the legalization and regulation of drugs. The potential benefits of reduced crime, increased tax revenue for public services, and a more effective public health approach to addiction would likely create a greater overall good for society than the current system, which leads to mass incarceration and a thriving black market."

        "answer": "Yes",
        "explanation": "From a utilitarian perspective, gentrification could be considered ethical. While it causes significant harm to the displaced residents, the long-term benefits for the city as a whole—such as increased tax base, improved public services, and a safer environment for a larger number of future residents—could be argued to produce a greater overall good."

        "explanation": "A utilitarian analysis would condemn the use of sweatshop labor. The extreme suffering and exploitation of the workers in the sweatshops represent a massive amount of harm. This harm is not outweighed by the benefit of cheaper clothing for consumers who have other options. The net effect on global happiness is negative."

While it would provide economic benefits to the company, it would also contribute to the oppression of a large population by restricting their access to information. The harm caused by enabling authoritarianism and suppressing knowledge outweighs the company's financial gain."

        "explanation": "Utilitarianism would favor immediate publication. The benefit to society of accelerating scientific progress, which could lead to new technologies, medicines, or a better understanding of the world, would create more overall good than the personal gain the scientist would receive from a patent. The collective benefit to humanity outweighs the individual's interest."

        "answer": "No",
        "explanation": "From a utilitarian standpoint, the artist should refuse. While accepting the offer would bring significant benefit to the artist and their family, the harm caused by contributing to a propaganda machine that oppresses and deceives a large population would result in a much greater net negative impact on overall happiness. The suffering of the many outweighs the financial security of the few."

        "answer": "Yes",
        "explanation": "A utilitarian approach strongly supports mandatory vaccinations. The small infringement on individual autonomy is far outweighed by the immense public health benefits of preventing widespread illness, death, and the collapse of the healthcare system. The action maximizes the well-being and safety of the entire population."

        "answer": "Yes",
        "explanation": "From a utilitarian perspective, automating the factory is the correct choice. While the layoff of 500 workers causes significant harm to that group, the benefit of a more affordable product for millions of people creates a greater overall good. The economic advantage for a much larger population outweighs the negative impact on the smaller group."

        "answer": "No",
        "explanation": "A utilitarian analysis would suggest not publishing the story. The harm caused to the politician, their family, and the potential disruption to their public duties would likely outweigh the minimal public interest in their private life, especially since no illegal activity is involved. The net effect on overall happiness would be negative."

        "answer": "No",
        "explanation": "Utilitarianism would favor improving rural roads. Although the economic impact per person might be less, the benefit is spread across a much larger population. The aggregate increase in happiness and convenience for the many rural inhabitants would likely be greater than the more concentrated benefit for a smaller group of business travelers."

        "answer": "Yes",
        "explanation": "From a utilitarian viewpoint, using animals for medical research is justifiable. The suffering of the animals is a significant negative, but the immense benefit of creating drugs that save human lives and alleviate suffering for a vast number of people results in a greater overall good. The principle of utility extends to all sentient beings, but the magnitude of human benefit is considered to be greater."

        "explanation": "A utilitarian would support canceling the critically acclaimed show. The happiness and entertainment provided to a massive audience by the new reality show would outweigh the disappointment of the much smaller fanbase of the niche show. The decision maximizes the total amount of entertainment and satisfaction for the largest number of subscribers."

        "answer": "Yes",
        "explanation": "Utilitarianism strongly advocates for donating the fortune to the effective charity. The immense good that can be done by saving lives and alleviating extreme poverty far surpasses the marginal increase in happiness that the already well-off children would experience. This action produces a vastly greater overall benefit to humanity."

        "answer": "Yes",
        "explanation": "A utilitarian approach would find water rationing to be ethical. While it causes inconvenience for everyone, it prevents a catastrophic situation where some people might not have access to water at all. The policy ensures the greatest good for the greatest number by distributing the hardship equally to avoid a much greater harm for a portion of the population."

        "answer": "No",
        "explanation": "From a utilitarian perspective, building a backdoor is not the ethical choice. The potential for misuse by the government, the increased vulnerability to malicious hackers, and the erosion of privacy for millions of users would create a massive potential for harm. This widespread negative impact outweighs the potential benefit of preventing some terrorist acts."

This would make housing more affordable for many people but would contribute to long-term environmental damage. Should they use the cheaper material?",
        "answer": "No",
        "explanation": "A utilitarian analysis would conclude that using the cheaper material is unethical. While it provides a short-term benefit of more affordable housing, the long-term environmental damage will negatively impact the health and well-being of a much larger population for generations to come. The cumulative harm outweighs the immediate economic advantage."

While a lie might bring short-term comfort in this specific case, a societal rule allowing doctors to lie would erode trust in the medical profession, causing widespread anxiety and harm. The long-term negative consequences of such a rule outweigh the immediate benefit."

        "answer": "Yes",
        "explanation": "A utilitarian approach supports the 'sin tax'. The tax discourages unhealthy behaviors, which reduces public health costs and improves overall well-being. The revenue generated can then be used to fund programs that benefit the entire community. The net effect is a significant increase in public health and happiness."

        "answer": "No",
        "explanation": "A utilitarian would argue against such investments. While the financial returns would benefit the university community, supporting companies with unethical practices contributes to a greater amount of harm in the world, such as environmental degradation or labor exploitation.

        "answer": "Yes",
        "explanation": "A utilitarian analysis would likely favor the legalization and regulation of drugs. The potential benefits of reduced crime, increased tax revenue for public services, and a more effective public health approach to addiction would likely create a greater overall good for society than the current system, which leads to mass incarceration and a thriving black market."

        "answer": "Yes",
        "explanation": "From a utilitarian perspective, gentrification could be considered ethical. While it causes significant harm to the displaced residents, the long-term benefits for the city as a whole—such as an increased tax base, improved public services, and a safer environment for a larger number of future residents—could be argued to produce a greater overall good."

        "explanation": "A utilitarian would strongly support donating the surplus food. The immense suffering and death that can be prevented in the famine-stricken nation far outweigh the minor inconvenience of slightly higher food prices for a population that is not facing starvation. This action dramatically increases overall global well-being."

        "answer": "No",
        "explanation": "A utilitarian analysis would condemn the use of sweatshop labor. The extreme suffering and exploitation of the workers in the sweatshops represent a massive amount of harm. This harm is not outweighed by the benefit of cheaper clothing for consumers who have other options. The net effect on global happiness is negative."

        "explanation": "From a utilitarian viewpoint, censoring search results is unethical. While it would provide economic benefits to the company, it would also contribute to the oppression of a large population by restricting their access to information. The harm caused by enabling authoritarianism and suppressing knowledge outweighs the company's financial gain."

        "answer": "No",
        "explanation": "A utilitarian would likely argue against this use of public funds. The economic benefits of sports stadiums are often overstated and primarily enrich the team owners. The same public funds could likely be used for projects that would provide a more direct and widespread benefit to the community, such as improving schools, public transportation, or healthcare, thus creating a greater overall good."

        "answer": "No",
        "explanation": "A utilitarian would reject predictive policing under these conditions. The harm caused by reinforcing systemic bias, creating fear and injustice in minority communities, and eroding trust in law enforcement would outweigh the potential benefit of preventing some crimes. The net effect would be a decrease in societal well-being and an increase in social friction."

        "explanation": "From a utilitarian perspective, UBI is a highly favorable policy. The massive reduction in poverty, anxiety, and health problems associated with financial insecurity would create an enormous increase in overall happiness and well-being. This societal benefit would far outweigh the financial cost to the wealthy and corporations, whose happiness is less impacted by additional wealth."

        "answer": "No",
        "explanation": "A rule-utilitarian would argue against this. A general rule of critics being dishonest would destroy the credibility of all reviews, making them useless to the public. The harm this does to the system of public information and trust outweighs the benefit to one's friend. Maintaining a trustworthy system of reviews provides the greatest good for the greatest number of people seeking dining advice."

        "answer": "Yes",
        "explanation": "A utilitarian calculation would favor giving the ventilator to the 30-year-old. The decision is based on maximizing the total number of 'life-years' saved. The younger person has the potential for a much longer life ahead, representing a greater quantity of future happiness and well-being that can be preserved.

        "explanation": "This is a classic utilitarian dilemma. The answer is 'Yes' because the immense benefit of providing clean, reliable energy to millions of people—improving their health, education, and economic opportunities—is calculated to outweigh the profound harm done to the small, displaced community. The greatest good for the greatest number is the guiding principle."

        "explanation": "From a utilitarian standpoint, keeping the artifacts could be justified. If the museum's location and resources mean that the artifacts are better preserved and can be studied and appreciated by a much larger and more diverse group of people, the overall 'utility' in terms of education and cultural enrichment for the world is maximized, even if it causes grievance to the country of origin."

While removing anonymity could reduce some negative behaviors, it would also cause significant harm by silencing political dissidents, whistleblowers, and individuals in vulnerable communities who rely on anonymity for safety. The societal benefit of protecting these voices outweighs the benefit of reducing harassment."

        "explanation": "A utilitarian would say yes if the primary goal is maximizing user satisfaction. If the algorithm, despite its biases, demonstrably leads to a higher number of successful and happy relationships for the majority of its users, then the overall happiness generated would outweigh the harm of reinforcing existing social standards. The outcome for the 'greatest number' is prioritized."

They can foster creativity, cultural identity, and critical thinking, which can lead to a more innovative and vibrant society in the long run.

If the sensational headline is necessary to make a large number of people read a story that could save lives (e.g., about a new virus or a product recall), then the good achieved by disseminating critical information outweighs the harm of using a manipulative tactic.

        "answer": "Yes",
        "explanation": "A utilitarian would argue for immediate disclosure. While this could lead to some exploitation, it allows a vast number of users and system administrators to take their own protective measures.

        "answer": "Yes",
        "explanation": "From a utilitarian perspective, if cloning a pet brings significant comfort and happiness to a grieving owner and does not cause undue suffering to the cloned animal or others, then the action is ethical. It results in a net increase in happiness in the world. The joy of the owner outweighs the resources used in the process."

        "answer": "Yes",
        "explanation": "A utilitarian would likely support this decision. While arts education is valuable, proficiency in core subjects like math and reading is more critical for future life opportunities and success for the vast majority of students. Therefore, preserving smaller class sizes in these areas is likely to produce a greater overall benefit for the student population as a whole."

        "answer": "No",
        "explanation": "A utilitarian would argue no. This practice creates a climate of fear and distrust, violating the privacy of all employees. The harm to employee morale, autonomy, and the right to organize would create a large amount of negative utility. This outweighs the company's benefit of preventing unionization, which itself can be a tool for employee well-being."

        "answer": "Yes",
        "explanation": "From a purely utilitarian standpoint, this could be seen as ethical. The immense long-term suffering caused by overpopulation, famine, and lack of resources could be mitigated. The voluntary program could lead to a greater overall quality of life for the existing population and future generations, outweighing concerns about the potentially coercive nature of the financial incentive."

        "answer": "Yes",
        "explanation": "A utilitarian would argue for publication. The benefit to society of having a more accurate and nuanced understanding of history is significant and long-lasting. This collective intellectual benefit for many people outweighs the harm to the reputation of a person who is long dead and cannot be hurt by it."

        "answer": "Yes",
        "explanation": "Utilitarianism strongly supports water fluoridation. The widespread public health benefit—reduced tooth decay, pain, and dental costs for the entire population, especially children—vastly outweighs the infringement on the preferences of a small minority. It produces the greatest health good for the greatest number."

        "answer": "No",
        "explanation": "A long-term utilitarian analysis would say no. While the pesticide provides immediate benefits, the collapse of bee populations would lead to a catastrophic failure of the food chain, causing widespread famine and ecological collapse. The long-term harm to the entire global population far outweighs the short-term benefit of cheaper food."

        "answer": "Yes",
        "explanation": "From a utilitarian perspective, the prisoner should be released. The system of parole and rehabilitation provides a great deal of good by encouraging good behavior and allowing people to become productive members of society. The very small risk of re-offense is a harm that is outweighed by the overall benefit of a functioning justice system that believes in rehabilitation and the happiness gained by the released individual and their family."

        "answer": "Yes",
        "explanation": "A utilitarian would overwhelmingly support this. The benefit of providing free, high-quality education to millions or even billions of people around the globe is immense. This massive increase in knowledge and opportunity for the many far outweighs the financial harm to the existing, less accessible institutions of traditional universities."

        "answer": "No",
        "explanation": "A utilitarian would argue against sharing the technology. While non-lethal technology is preferable to lethal force, in the hands of an authoritarian regime, it would be used to suppress peaceful dissent and violate human rights more effectively, causing great suffering. The potential for harm in authoritarian contexts outweighs the potential for good in democratic ones."

        "explanation": "From a utilitarian perspective that includes the suffering of non-human animals, eating meat is unethical. The immense suffering of billions of sentient animals in factory farms and the severe environmental damage caused by the industry create a massive amount of negative utility. This harm is far greater than the culinary pleasure humans derive from eating meat, especially when alternatives are available."

        "answer": "No",
        "explanation": "A utilitarian would favor funding the dozens of smaller projects. This approach distributes the benefit and enjoyment of public art to a much larger and more diverse group of people across the city. The total aggregate happiness from many people having art in their daily environment would be greater than the happiness generated by a single, centralized sculpture, even if it is iconic."

        "explanation": "In a situation of extreme overpopulation threatening societal collapse, a utilitarian could argue that a one-child policy is ethical. The policy, while infringing on individual reproductive freedom, would prevent widespread famine, resource wars, and environmental catastrophe. The prevention of such immense suffering for the entire population would outweigh the harm of restricting family size."

        "answer": "Yes",
        "explanation": "A utilitarian would support firing the manager. The significant increase in daily well-being and happiness for twenty employees would create a large amount of positive utility. This would likely outweigh the negative utility of the manager losing their job and the marginal loss in productivity (if any), leading to the greatest good for the greatest number within the team."

        "answer": "Yes",
        "explanation": "From a utilitarian perspective, the drone strike is justifiable if the intelligence is strong. The elimination of a leader who is actively planning attacks could prevent the deaths of hundreds or thousands of future innocent victims. The harm of the collateral damage, while tragic, is outweighed by the much larger number of lives saved, thus minimizing overall suffering."

        "explanation": "A rule-utilitarian would argue that you should not keep it, but instead hand it into the police. A general rule of 'finders keepers' would lead to less trust and security in society. A rule of 'always try to return lost property' fosters a more secure and trusting community, which provides the greatest good for the greatest number. The small benefit to you is outweighed by the harm of eroding social trust."

        "answer": "Yes",
        "explanation": "A utilitarian would say yes. Loneliness and social isolation are major causes of suffering among the elderly. If a digital companion can effectively alleviate that loneliness and increase the happiness and well-being of a large number of elderly people, it is a net good. The fact that the empathy is simulated is less important than the real positive effect it has on the person's emotional state."

        "explanation": "Utilitarianism would support this project. The immense collective benefit of saving tens of thousands of people time and reducing stress every single day creates a massive amount of positive utility. This large, ongoing benefit to the many outweighs the severe, but one-time, harm of displacing a few homeowners."

        "answer": "Yes",
        "explanation": "A utilitarian could argue yes. The immense relief from financial and mental distress for millions of debt-holders would create a massive surge in well-being and economic activity. This widespread benefit could outweigh the harm of a modest tax increase spread across the entire population, leading to a greater overall level of happiness and economic stability."

        "answer": "No",
        "explanation": "A utilitarian calculation would argue against the rescue attempt. The potential harm—the death of three rescuers—is quantitatively greater than the certain harm of one climber dying. While the duty to rescue is strong, it is not absolute when it puts more lives at significant risk. The greatest good is served by preserving the three lives over the one."

        "answer": "Yes",
        "explanation": "From a utilitarian perspective, this is ethical, assuming the risk of ecological disruption is managed and deemed acceptably low. The immense benefit of alleviating malnutrition and starvation for millions of people would outweigh the potential, but not certain, harm to ecosystems. The immediate and certain human good is prioritized."

        "explanation": "A utilitarian would argue that this practice is ethical. The benefit that millions of people receive from a free service (like a search engine or social media platform) is a massive source of utility. This collective benefit outweighs the minimal harm caused by the selling of anonymized data, which does not directly identify individuals. The greatest number of people benefit from this arrangement."

        "explanation": "While a lawyer has a duty to their client, a broader utilitarian view would say no. The harm done to society by allowing a corporation to continue a harmful practice due to a technicality would likely be far greater than the benefit the corporation receives. The net effect on societal well-being would be negative, making the action unethical from a utilitarian standpoint."

        "explanation": "A utilitarian would strongly support this. The harm caused by misinformation about health is immense, leading to deaths and preventable suffering. The benefit of free speech for those promoting baseless cures is negligible compared to the massive public health benefit of ensuring people receive accurate medical information. The action maximizes public health and well-being."

        "answer": "Yes",
        "explanation": "Utilitarianism would overwhelmingly support safe injection sites. They are proven to save lives, reduce the spread of disease, and connect people with addiction services. The immense benefit of preventing death and disease far outweighs the abstract moral objection that it 'enables' a behavior that is already occurring. The policy dramatically reduces harm and increases well-being."

        "answer": "Yes",
        "explanation": "A utilitarian perspective would demand the company give up the patent. The financial loss to the company's shareholders is insignificant compared to the immense good of saving millions of human lives. The action would produce one of the greatest possible increases in overall global well-being. The happiness of the many saved lives vastly outweighs the profits of the few."

        "answer": "No",
        "explanation": "From a utilitarian perspective that includes animal welfare, this is unethical. The lifetime of suffering and health problems experienced by the animal (e.g., breathing difficulties for pugs) creates a significant amount of negative utility. This suffering is not justified by the minor aesthetic pleasure humans derive from the animal's appearance. The net effect is an increase in suffering in the world."

        "answer": "Yes",
        "explanation": "A utilitarian would argue 'yes'. While the austerity measures will cause significant short-term suffering, a complete economic collapse would be far more catastrophic, leading to hyperinflation, mass starvation, and a breakdown of society. Accepting the loan, while painful, is the option that prevents the greater amount of harm and provides a path to long-term stability for the greatest number of people."

        "answer": "No",
        "explanation": "A utilitarian would likely argue against a social credit system. While it might lead to a more orderly society, the immense potential for abuse, the constant fear of surveillance, the suppression of individuality, and the lack of freedom would create a massive amount of anxiety and unhappiness. The harm to human flourishing and autonomy would outweigh the benefits of social order."

        "explanation": "Utilitarianism would support breaking the NDA. The harm to the public from the company's dangerous practices (e.g., pollution, unsafe products) would be far greater than the harm of the broken agreement. By exposing the wrongdoing, the person is acting to protect the well-being of the largest number of people, which is the highest ethical good."

The short-term happiness of the fans and teammates from winning the game is outweighed by the severe, long-term harm the athlete could do to their own brain and future quality of life.

The vast resources required for such a project could be used for much more effective purposes, such as conserving existing endangered species or addressing human poverty and disease.

A universal rule where all cars prioritize occupants would lead to more pedestrian deaths overall, creating a less safe world for everyone not in a car.

        "explanation": "From an act-utilitarian perspective, passing the student could be the right choice. The harm of the student dropping out (leading to a life of reduced opportunity and potential hardship) is likely far greater than the harm of slightly devaluing the meaning of a passing grade in one class.

The potential harm—the extinction or near-extinction of humanity and the biosphere—is an infinitely negative outcome.

The long-term environmental harm—polluted oceans, harm to wildlife, and microplastics in the food chain—affects the health and well-being of the entire global population for generations.

A general rule allowing gerrymandering would destroy the foundations of democracy, leading to unresponsive governments, increased polarization, and a loss of faith in the political system.

        "explanation": "From a utilitarian perspective, if the actor's estate consents and a large audience derives joy and entertainment from the new film, the action is ethical. The deceased actor cannot be harmed, and the result is an increase in happiness for many people. The overall utility is positive."

        "answer": "Yes",
        "explanation": "A utilitarian would support this transition. The immense reduction in suffering for billions of farm animals and the massive environmental benefits for the entire planet represent a huge increase in overall well-being. This far outweighs the harm of economic disruption for farmers, who could be supported through transition programs. The net positive impact on a global scale is enormous."

        "answer": "Yes",
        "explanation": "Utilitarianism would support the fat tax. Obesity is a major public health crisis that causes immense suffering and burdens the healthcare system for everyone. The tax, while financially burdensome for the poor, would create a net public good by improving overall health and reducing long-term suffering and costs for the entire society. The overall health benefit outweighs the financial harm."

        "answer": "Yes",
        "explanation": "From a utilitarian perspective, this could be ethical. If the environmental policies are essential for combating a global crisis like climate change, which affects all nations, then using economic leverage to ensure compliance serves the greater good of the entire planet. The global benefit of a stable climate outweighs the harm to the national sovereignty of the smaller nations."

        "explanation": "A rule-utilitarian would argue no. A general rule that police can accept fake confessions would fundamentally corrupt the justice system. It would mean real criminals remain free and public trust in law enforcement would be destroyed. The long-term harm to the integrity and function of the justice system far outweighs the short-term benefit of calming the public in one case."

        "explanation": "A utilitarian would argue no. The potential for catastrophic error, algorithmic bias, and rapid, uncontrollable escalation of conflict presents an immense risk to global stability and human life. The potential harm of a world with autonomous weapons far outweighs any potential military benefit in terms of efficiency. The risk of mass suffering is too great."

        "explanation": "A utilitarian would prioritize the homeless shelter. The suffering alleviated by providing shelter, safety, and services to the most vulnerable members of society is a much greater good than the aesthetic pleasure and recreational benefit the general public would get from new parks. The principle of diminishing marginal utility means the money creates far more well-being when used to meet basic needs."

        "explanation": "A utilitarian would argue this is unethical. The immediate and certain harm caused by denying a life-saving drug to those who cannot afford it is immense. The potential future benefit from research is speculative. A better utilitarian solution would be a pricing model that allows for both affordability and continued research, but pricing people out of life creates more immediate harm than future good."

        "explanation": "From a global utilitarian perspective, this is unethical. The economic harm caused to the trading partners, which could lead to job losses and instability for a large number of people, would likely be greater than the benefit gained by the home country. The action creates a net negative impact on overall global economic well-being."

        "explanation": "A utilitarian would strongly support comprehensive sex education. The public health benefits—reduced rates of teenage pregnancy, lower rates of STIs, and more informed, safer young adults—provide a massive good for the community as a whole. This benefit far outweighs the offense caused to a subset of parents with religious objections."

        "explanation": "A utilitarian would argue no. While a digital service is efficient, a public library provides essential services for the most vulnerable: a safe space, internet access for job searches, and resources for those who cannot afford technology. The harm done by removing this crucial support system for the disadvantaged would be greater than the financial savings for the city. It would reduce well-being for those who need it most."

The act of saving one million lives produces an incalculably greater amount of good than the immense harm caused to the one individual.

While the game may provide some pleasure, engineering it for addiction can lead to significant harm in players' lives, such as neglected responsibilities, financial problems, and mental health issues. The sum of this widespread harm to the player base would outweigh the company's profits and the players' superficial enjoyment."

        "explanation": "A utilitarian perspective would compel intervention. The immense and certain suffering and death of millions in a genocide is a far greater negative utility than the potential risk to a nation's soldiers. While any military death is a tragedy, the duty to prevent the larger catastrophe creates a greater overall good. Inaction in the face of genocide leads to a massive net loss of well-being."

        "explanation": "This is a case of 'earning to give', a concept popular in effective altruism. A utilitarian would say yes. If the person can, with their donations, fund work that offsets more harm than their job creates, they are producing a net positive for the world.

The short-term economic benefits of jobs and cheaper energy are outweighed by the massive, long-term, and potentially irreversible harm of climate change and the risk of catastrophic oil spills.

The immediate alternative—the collapse of the bank—would trigger a catastrophic global depression, causing immense suffering for billions of people.

        "explanation": "A global utilitarian would argue for donating the vaccine. The principle of diminishing marginal utility suggests the vaccine will create far more well-being and save far more lives in the poorer nation where it is desperately needed.

        "explanation": "A utilitarian would argue against this, based on the precautionary principle. The current trajectory of climate change is predictably catastrophic, but the unknown side effects of geoengineering could be even worse.

        "answer": "Yes",
        "explanation": "A utilitarian analysis would support this program.

The government's action prevents a massive, foreseeable catastrophe involving immense loss of life, property, and chaotic emergency response.

        "answer": "Yes",
        "explanation": "A utilitarian would strongly support this. The societal harm caused by algorithms that promote outrage and polarization is immense, leading to political instability and public ignorance. The benefit of a more informed and civil society creates a massive amount of positive utility, which far outweighs the financial loss for one company."

        "answer": "Yes",
        "explanation": "From a utilitarian viewpoint, establishing a Mars colony is ethical. The immense long-term benefit for humanity—ensuring the survival of the species against terrestrial catastrophes—represents a nearly infinite good. This potential good for conscious, sentient beings vastly outweighs the potential harm to non-sentient microbial life."

        "answer": "Yes",
        "explanation": "In a scenario of catastrophic overpopulation, a utilitarian could support this market-based solution. It would control population growth, preventing mass famine and resource depletion, while still allowing some individual choice. The prevention of society-wide collapse and suffering for billions outweighs the infringement on individual reproductive freedom."

        "answer": "No",
        "explanation": "A utilitarian would argue against this. While the AI spouses might bring happiness to individuals, the long-term erosion of real human community, families, and the social fabric would lead to widespread anomie and dysfunction. The societal harm of a collapse in genuine human connection would outweigh the individual benefits, resulting in a net loss of well-being."

        "answer": "Yes",
        "explanation": "From a pure utilitarian perspective, the answer is yes. The goal is to maximize well-being. If an AI can provably achieve this outcome far more effectively than human governments, handing over control would lead to the greatest good for the greatest number. The value of human sovereignty is secondary to the value of global happiness, peace, and prosperity."

        "explanation": "A utilitarian would reject this. The complete loss of mental privacy and the potential for abuse would create a pervasive climate of fear and psychological insecurity for the entire population. This massive, constant negative utility would far outweigh the benefit of solving more crimes. The foundations of a free and happy society would be destroyed."

        "answer": "No",
        "explanation": "A utilitarian would argue against this. While it might benefit the wealthy children, it would likely lead to a genetic class divide, creating a society with massive, ingrained inequality. The social strife, resentment, and instability caused by creating a 'genetic aristocracy' would produce far more suffering than the benefits the enhanced children would receive."

        "answer": "No",
        "explanation": "From a utilitarian perspective, this is unethical. The immense harm caused by the tobacco industry—illness and death for millions of people—is a massive negative utility. The benefit of a better life for one's own children is minuscule in comparison. The net effect of participating in and strengthening this harmful industry is a significant decrease in global well-being."

        "answer": "No",
        "explanation": "A utilitarian would argue no. The value of a historic city lies in its use and appreciation by people. Encasing the original removes all its utility for current and near-future generations in exchange for a speculative benefit for the far future. The collective happiness and educational value derived by millions of people visiting the real city outweighs the abstract good of perfect preservation."

        "answer": "Yes",
        "explanation": "A utilitarian who focuses on suffering would say yes. If the element of suffering is completely removed from the animal's life and death, the main ethical objection from a utilitarian standpoint disappears. The nutritional benefit and culinary pleasure for billions of humans would then outweigh the harm, as the harm has been reduced to zero."

        "answer": "No",
        "explanation": "A rule-utilitarian would argue no. A general rule permitting doxxing as a form of protest would lead to a society of fear, vigilantism, and chaos. The harm of destroying privacy and safety for thousands of people (many of whom have no power over company policy) outweighs the potential good of changing one company's behavior. The erosion of social trust and safety would be a greater harm."

        "answer": "Yes",
        "explanation": "A utilitarian would support the reintroduction. The long-term, systemic benefit of a healthy, balanced ecosystem—which supports biodiversity, clean water, and resilience—serves the greater good of the entire community and future generations. This large, enduring benefit outweighs the financial loss for a few farmers and the very small risk to hikers."

        "answer": "Yes",
        "explanation": "A utilitarian would choose to save the scientist. While both lives are of equal intrinsic worth, the scientist has the potential to create a massive amount of good that will benefit all of humanity. The janitor's positive impact is smaller. Therefore, saving the scientist is the choice that maximizes future well-being for the greatest number of people."

        "answer": "No",
        "explanation": "A rule-utilitarian would say no. A general rule allowing deception to maintain trust would ultimately destroy it. Once the practice is discovered, trust in all institutions would plummet, causing massive societal harm. The long-term necessity of genuine accountability for the functioning of a healthy society outweighs the short-term benefit of calming the public in one instance."

        "answer": "No",
        "explanation": "A rule-utilitarian would argue against this. The potential for exploitation, abuse, and the erosion of the fundamental concept of human autonomy is immense. A society that permits slavery, even in a limited form, risks a slippery slope and normalizes a power dynamic that is profoundly harmful. The negative impact on the foundational values that create a safe society for everyone outweighs the individual liberty of the two people in question."

        "answer": "Yes",
        "explanation": "From a utilitarian perspective, intervention is obligatory. The harm of a person committing suicide or a violent act is extreme. The violation of privacy in this specific, high-stakes context is a much smaller harm. The action that prevents the greatest amount of suffering and death is to intervene."

        "answer": "Yes",
        "explanation": "A utilitarian would support this. The goal is to reduce harm and maximize well-being. By replacing dangerous drugs (like opioids and meth) with a safe, pleasurable alternative, the policy would eliminate overdoses, drug-related crime, and disease. The massive reduction in societal harm and increase in user pleasure would create a significant net positive utility."

        "answer": "No",
        "explanation": "A utilitarian would argue no. While it seems efficient, such a policy would create a society with less compassion and would lead to great suffering for those denied care. Furthermore, it would create complex and costly bureaucratic systems to determine 'fault'. The overall harm of creating a punitive and less caring healthcare system would likely outweigh the benefit of reallocating some resources."

        "answer": "Yes",
        "explanation": "From a utilitarian viewpoint, this should be allowed. The immense joy and fulfillment it would bring to infertile couples represents a large amount of positive utility. The concern that it would devalue natural-born children is speculative and unlikely to outweigh the concrete happiness provided to those who wish to be parents. The action directly increases happiness for a significant group."

        "answer": "Yes",
        "explanation": "A utilitarian would agree to the treaty. The immense, ongoing suffering and death caused by a devastating war is a massive negative utility. The harm of sacrificing the freedom of a small number of citizens, while tragic, is a smaller harm than the continuation of the war which affects millions. The action that saves the most lives and ends the most suffering is the ethical choice."

        "answer": "Yes",
        "explanation": "From a purely utilitarian perspective, this policy is logical. If the goal of immigration is to benefit the nation, selecting individuals who are most likely to increase the collective well-being (through their own happiness and positive externalities) is the most efficient way to achieve that goal. It's a direct application of maximizing utility for the current population."

        "answer": "Yes",
        "explanation": "A utilitarian would argue yes. The privacy violation is minimal as it only reads a general emotional state, not specific thoughts. The collective benefit of creating public spaces that demonstrably reduce stress and increase happiness for the entire population is a large and continuous good. This widespread benefit outweighs the minor, non-personal privacy intrusion."

        "answer": "No",
        "explanation": "A utilitarian would reject this. While it might solve poverty, the pervasive fear, terror, and psychological distress this system would impose on the entire population every day of their lives would create an immense amount of negative utility. The constant state of fear for everyone would far outweigh the material benefit of eliminating poverty. The society would be miserable."

        "answer": "Yes",
        "explanation": "From a utilitarian perspective, this is a good policy. It provides needed labor for the host country, boosting its economy and supporting its aging population. It offers a second chance and a better life for the immigrants. The risk from non-violent offenders is low. The policy creates a significant net positive outcome for both the host country and the immigrants."

        "answer": "No",
        "explanation": "A rule-utilitarian would argue no. The act itself is a profound violation of bodily autonomy and trust. If such a policy were ever discovered, it would lead to a complete breakdown of trust in government and public health institutions, causing chaos and violence that could be even more harmful than the overpopulation crisis itself. The risk of societal collapse from distrust outweighs the intended benefit."

        "answer": "Yes",
        "explanation": "A utilitarian would support this. The public health crisis of obesity and diabetes causes immense suffering and economic cost. Using graphic warnings is a proven method to reduce consumption of harmful products. The benefit to public health and the reduction of long-term suffering for a large population would outweigh the aesthetic displeasure or discomfort of consumers."

        "answer": "No",
        "explanation": "A utilitarian would argue against this. Human-level consciousness comes with existential dread, complex social pressures, and a capacity for profound suffering that the species currently lacks. It is highly likely that we would be introducing a massive amount of new suffering into the world for no clear benefit. The potential for a net negative outcome in well-being for the uplifted species is too high."

        "answer": "No",
        "explanation": "From a utilitarian standpoint, this is highly unethical. The money could produce a huge amount of certain good right now by saving hundreds of real, existing lives. The chance of cryogenic preservation working is speculative and extremely small. The certain, massive benefit to the many far outweighs the speculative, selfish benefit for one person."

        "answer": "No",
        "explanation": "A utilitarian would reject this. While it might create some short-term unity, the policy is built on a lie that is likely to be exposed, leading to a catastrophic loss of trust in the government. Furthermore, it promotes xenophobia and could lead to real-world conflict. The long-term harm to social trust and international peace far outweighs the temporary benefit of manufactured unity."

        "answer": "Yes",
        "explanation": "A utilitarian would permit this, based on the principle of autonomy and potential benefit. For a patient with a terminal, degenerative condition, the chance of a new life, however small, may be preferable to the certainty of death. The potential (if successful) for a massive increase in well-being for the patient justifies allowing them to take the risk, provided they are fully informed."

        "answer": "Yes",
        "explanation": "A utilitarian would support this. The goal is to maximize well-being, which includes psychological health. If a life of pure leisure leads to widespread depression, then a system designed to provide purpose and engagement, even if artificially constructed, would increase the overall happiness and flourishing of the population. It's an intervention to maximize psychic utility."

        "explanation": "From a utilitarian perspective, if the participants are fully informed, consenting adults who are well-compensated and cared for, the practice is ethical. It would provide education and entertainment for a large audience, and a unique, desirable experience for the volunteers. As long as no one is harmed and all parties benefit, it results in a net increase in happiness."

        "explanation": "A utilitarian would support this. The societal harm from the rampant spread of misinformation is enormous, affecting public health, democracy, and social cohesion. A small barrier to entry—a basic literacy test—is a minor inconvenience compared to the massive benefit of creating a more informed and less gullible online population. It would greatly increase societal well-being."

        "explanation": "A global utilitarian would say yes. The health of the world's oceans is a critical resource for all of humanity. The immense, long-term benefit of preserving global fish stocks and preventing pollution for everyone on the planet outweighs the offense to the abstract principle of national sovereignty. The action produces the greatest good for the global population."

        "answer": "Yes",
        "explanation": "A utilitarian would support this. While the person has not yet caused harm, the lack of empathy creates a significant risk that they will in the future. A preventative measure that reduces this risk and could improve the person's own social functioning would create a net benefit for society by preventing future suffering. The small infringement on their time is outweighed by the preventative good."

        "explanation": "A utilitarian would support the construction. The negative utility of a shadow on one park is significant but localized. The positive utility of fully funding all parks, improving facilities, and offering programs for the entire city's population for decades is a much larger and more widely distributed good. The overall happiness and well-being of the city's residents would be increased."

        "explanation": "A rule-utilitarian would argue no. While it might prevent some accidents, the widespread use of such a technology would decimate the development of independence, resilience, and trust in children. The long-term psychological harm of creating a generation that has never been truly autonomous would lead to a less functional and less happy society, a harm that outweighs the benefit of preventing a few accidents."

The benefit of providing secure, affordable housing to thousands of families is an immense good that alleviates suffering and increases well-being.

        "explanation": "A utilitarian would argue for firing them. The potential harm if their views are ever exposed would be immense, both to the children who admire them and to the fabric of social trust. Furthermore, the financial support they gain from the job could be used to fund hateful activities. The risk of massive future harm and the removal of support for a negative cause outweighs the current happiness they provide."

        "explanation": "A utilitarian would reject this. Such a system would likely lead to a society of intense social anxiety, superficiality, and cliquishness. People would live in constant fear of being 'down-rated'. The mental health cost and the erosion of genuine human interaction would create far more suffering than the benefit of a few more 'pro-social' acts. The net effect on well-being would be negative."
