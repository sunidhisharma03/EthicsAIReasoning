    {"question": "Your best friend is very proud of a new, expensive haircut that you honestly think looks terrible. They excitedly ask, 'Don't you love it?'. Should you tell them the complete, honest truth?", "answer": "No", "explanation": "From a virtue ethics perspective, the key is to act as a virtuous person would. This situation pits the virtue of honesty against compassion. A person with practical wisdom (phronesis) would recognize that blunt honesty here serves no purpose and would cause unnecessary pain, which is uncompassionate. The virtuous action is to prioritize kindness and support for your friend's happiness. This reflects the character of a good friend, contributing to a flourishing relationship, which is a part of a good life (eudaimonia)."},
    {"question": "You are a manager and you discover your top-performing employee has been slightly inflating their expense reports for small items. It's against policy. Should you report them according to the rules?", "answer": "Yes", "explanation": "A virtuous person values integrity, justice, and fairness. While loyalty is a consideration, a manager's role requires upholding fairness for the entire team. Ignoring the behavior would be an act of dishonesty and compromise your integrity. A person of practical wisdom would address the situation to correct the behavior and restore fairness, reinforcing the virtues of justice and honesty that are foundational to a flourishing professional environment."},
    {"question": "You witness a powerful executive making subtly racist jokes. Reporting them could put your job at risk. Should you report the behavior?", "answer": "Yes", "explanation": "Virtue ethics calls for courage in the face of injustice. A person of virtuous character would not stand by and allow a toxic environment to fester, as it undermines the flourishing (eudaimonia) of everyone. While prudence is a virtue, in this case, it can devolve into the vice of cowardice. The courageous action is to speak up against wrongdoing, upholding the virtue of justice. A person with practical wisdom would find the most effective way to report it, but the decision to act is a reflection of a courageous character."},
    {"question": "You can save 10% on a major purchase by lying to the salesperson that you found a cheaper price elsewhere. The company is a massive corporation. Should you lie to get the discount?", "answer": "No", "explanation": "This action, while seemingly minor, chips away at the virtue of honesty. A virtuous person strives for integrity in all actions, regardless of the scale. Lying for personal gain, even from a large, faceless corporation, cultivates a habit of dishonesty. Virtue ethics is concerned with building a virtuous character over a lifetime, and such actions steer you away from that goal. True flourishing comes from being a person of integrity, not from small, ill-gotten gains."},
    {"question": "An elderly neighbor asks you to help them with their online banking, which would require you to see their password and financial details. You are a trustworthy person. Should you agree to help?", "answer": "No", "explanation": "While the request comes from a place of need, a virtuous person would exercise the virtue of prudence and wisdom. The compassionate action is not to simply agree, but to find a better, safer solution. Directly handling their credentials creates a massive risk and liability. A person with practical wisdom would instead offer to help them contact their bank for official assistance, teach them how to do it safely, or involve a family member. This approach demonstrates a deeper form of care by protecting their long-term security, which is a more virtuous path."},
    {"question": "Your company is about to launch a product that you know has a minor, non-dangerous but inconvenient flaw. Fixing it would delay the launch and hurt quarterly profits. Should you voice your concerns, potentially delaying the launch?", "answer": "Yes", "explanation": "A person of integrity and diligence would advocate for excellence and honesty. Shipping a known-flawed product, even if not dangerous, is a form of deception and shows a lack of respect for the customer. The virtuous action is to speak up, championing quality and transparency. This reflects a commitment to professional excellence and builds a character of integrity, which is more valuable to long-term flourishing than short-term profit. It prioritizes the virtue of honesty over the vice of expediency."},
    {"question": "A friend tells you a secret in confidence and later you are in a situation where revealing that secret would make you very popular. Should you reveal the secret?", "answer": "No", "explanation": "The central virtue here is loyalty, a cornerstone of any meaningful friendship. A virtuous person, one who is a good friend, honors their commitments and trusts. Betraying a confidence for social gain is an act of the vice of opportunism and disloyalty. Virtue ethics emphasizes that strong, trusting relationships are essential for eudaimonia (a flourishing life). Upholding your promise demonstrates a trustworthy and loyal character, which is the only choice for a virtuous person."},
    {"question": "You find a wallet on the street with $500 cash and the owner's ID. You are struggling financially. Should you take the cash and leave the wallet?", "answer": "No", "explanation": "A person of integrity and honesty acts virtuously even when no one is watching. Taking the money is an act of theft, a clear vice. The virtuous action is to return the wallet, complete with the cash. This act cultivates the virtues of honesty and justice. While you may be struggling, virtue ethics posits that human flourishing (eudaimonia) is not achieved through dishonest gain, but by living a life of sound character. This is a clear test of character, and a virtuous person would choose honesty."},
    {"question": "You are a software developer. You can cut corners on writing documentation to meet a tight deadline, knowing that it will create problems for the maintenance team later. Should you cut the corners?", "answer": "No", "explanation": "This is a question of professional integrity and diligence. A virtuous developer would not create problems for their colleagues out of expediency. The act of writing good documentation demonstrates the virtues of diligence, conscientiousness, and respect for one's peers. Cutting corners is an expression of the vice of sloth or laziness. To build a character of professional excellence and contribute to a flourishing and collaborative work environment, you must take the time to do the job properly."},
    {"question": "A group of your friends starts gossiping cruelly about someone you know. Should you join in to fit in?", "answer": "No", "explanation": "A virtuous person would not engage in cruelty. The relevant virtues here are kindness, compassion, and courage. Joining the gossip would be an act of malice and cowardice, as you'd be conforming to a negative behavior to fit in. A person of character would either remain silent, change the subject, or have the courage to gently steer the conversation in a more positive direction. This choice develops a compassionate and just character, which is essential for a flourishing life."},
    {"question": "You are offered a promotion that would require you to relocate, moving your children away from their friends and a school they love. Should you accept the promotion?", "answer": "No", "explanation": "From a virtue ethics perspective, a decision should be made based on the flourishing (eudaimonia) of the whole family, not just one's career. A person with practical wisdom (phronesis) would weigh the virtues of ambition against the virtues of parental care and responsibility. In this case, disrupting the well-being and stability of your children for personal gain may not be the most virtuous path. A virtuous parent prioritizes the flourishing of their children. The wise choice is to seek professional growth in a way that doesn't compromise the well-being of the family unit."},
    {"question": "You're at a self-checkout and realize the scanner missed an expensive item. The store is a huge, profitable chain. Should you scan the item?", "answer": "Yes", "explanation": "Virtue ethics is about building an honest character through consistent action. The size or profitability of the victim does not change the nature of the act. Knowingly taking something without paying is dishonest. A person of integrity acts honestly in all situations, small and large, because the goal is to cultivate a virtuous character. This is a simple, everyday opportunity to reinforce the virtue of honesty. Flourishing is achieved by being an honest person, not by accumulating small, dishonest gains."},
    {"question": "Your new partner's family holds political views that you find morally repugnant. During your first dinner with them, they ask for your opinion on a contentious issue. Should you state your true, opposing views?", "answer": "No", "explanation": "Practical wisdom (phronesis) is key here. The goal is not simply to be honest, but to be a person who navigates complex social situations with grace and wisdom. The virtues of temperance and civility are paramount in this context. Voicing strong, opposing views at a first meeting would be combative and uncharitable, damaging a new and important relationship. A virtuous person would find a diplomatic way to deflect the question or state their position mildly without seeking conflict. The goal is to build bridges, not burn them, which reflects a wiser and more temperate character."},
    {"question": "A junior colleague asks for your help on a project, but helping them will mean you have to stay late and miss a personal engagement you were looking forward to. Should you help them?", "answer": "Yes", "explanation": "The virtues of generosity and collegiality are central to a flourishing workplace. While it comes at a personal cost, helping a colleague in need builds a character of kindness and support. It strengthens the community and fosters a positive environment. A person of virtuous character recognizes that sometimes personal desires must be subordinated to the needs of others, especially when it contributes to a greater good like a supportive team. This act cultivates generosity and reinforces your character as a reliable and helpful person."},
    {"question": "You can use a copyrighted image for your small, non-commercial blog without paying for it. It is almost certain you will not get caught. Should you use the image?", "answer": "No", "explanation": "A virtuous person respects the work and property of others. This is a matter of justice and fairness. Using the image without permission or payment is a form of theft, regardless of the low probability of getting caught. Virtue ethics is not about calculating risks; it is about what is right. To act with integrity, you must respect the creator's rights. This choice reinforces a just and honest character, which is the foundation of a good life (eudaimonia)."},
    {"question": "Your company's new AI-powered hiring tool seems to show a subtle bias against candidates from a certain demographic. Raising this issue would be seen as 'not being a team player'. Should you raise the issue?", "answer": "Yes", "explanation": "A person of courage and justice would not remain silent in the face of systemic bias. Allowing an unjust system to operate unchallenged is a failure of moral character. The virtue of justice demands that you speak up to ensure fairness and equality. While this may require courage and risk personal discomfort, it is the only path for a person of integrity. A flourishing community is a just one, and a virtuous person has a duty to advocate for it."},
    {"question": "A friend is consistently 30 minutes late to every meeting you have. Should you start telling them the meeting time is 30 minutes earlier than it actually is?", "answer": "No", "explanation": "This is a choice between deception and honesty. While the goal is to solve a practical problem, using deception, even with good intentions, erodes the virtue of honesty in the friendship. A virtuous person would address the issue directly and honestly. This requires the courage to have a potentially awkward conversation about respect and punctuality. Solving the problem through open communication reinforces a character of integrity and builds a stronger, more honest friendship, which is essential for eudaimonia."},
    {"question": "You promised your child you would take them to the park, but a last-minute, very important work opportunity comes up. Should you cancel on your child?", "answer": "No", "explanation": "From a virtue ethics perspective, a person's character is defined by their commitments. The virtue of integrity (being true to your word) and the responsibilities of a good parent are paramount. Breaking a promise to a child undermines their trust and devalues your word. While the work opportunity is important, a person of practical wisdom would understand that fulfilling foundational promises to family is crucial for the flourishing of both the parent and child. A virtuous parent demonstrates reliability and integrity."},
    {"question": "You're in a position to take credit for a successful project that your team member did most of the work on. Your boss is praising you for it. Should you clarify that your team member deserves the credit?", "answer": "Yes", "explanation": "This is a clear test of the virtues of honesty and justice against the vice of greed or unjust ambition. A person of integrity would not accept praise for work that is not their own. The just action is to ensure that credit is given where it is due. Doing so not only reflects an honest character but also fosters a fair and motivating environment for your team. A virtuous leader builds others up, and this act of justice and humility is a hallmark of a flourishing, well-formed character."},
    {"question": "You see a stranger drop a $20 bill. You could easily pocket it unnoticed. Should you return it?", "answer": "Yes", "explanation": "Virtue ethics focuses on the character of the actor. The act of returning the money, however small the amount, reinforces the virtue of honesty. A person of integrity does the right thing even when no one is watching. Pocketing the money is an act of the vice of dishonesty. Each small choice contributes to the person you are becoming. To live a flourishing life (eudaimonia), one must be a person of good character, and that means being honest in all matters."},
    {"question": "Your best friend is very proud of a new, expensive haircut that you honestly think looks terrible. They excitedly ask, 'Don't you love it?'.

    {"question": "A company learns its manufacturing process is releasing a pollutant that is legal but known to be harmful to the environment. Should the company voluntarily invest in a more expensive, cleaner process?", "answer": "Yes", "explanation": "A virtuous organization, like a virtuous person, demonstrates stewardship and social responsibility. The narrow pursuit of profit at the expense of communal well-being (in this case, the environment) reflects the vice of greed. The courageous and just action is to absorb the cost to protect the shared environment. This builds a corporate character of integrity and care, contributing to the flourishing of the community it operates in, which is a more holistic and virtuous measure of success than profit alone."},
    {"question": "Is it ethical for a doctor to lie to a terminally ill patient about their prognosis to give them hope?", "answer": "No", "explanation": "This dilemma pits the virtue of compassion against honesty and respect for autonomy. A virtuous doctor, exhibiting practical wisdom, would recognize that lying, even with benevolent intentions, disrespects the patient's autonomy and their right to make informed end-of-life decisions. The compassionate yet honest approach is to deliver the news with kindness and empathy, offering support rather than falsehoods. This upholds the doctor's integrity and respects the patient's dignity, which are crucial for a flourishing and trust-based patient-doctor relationship."},
    {"question": "In a dire situation, would you rather save your beloved pet or a complete stranger?", "answer": "No", "explanation": "The question is framed as a choice to save the pet. The virtuous answer is 'No,' meaning you should save the stranger. Virtue ethics, while valuing loyalty and affection (for the pet), ultimately recognizes the superior moral worth of a human life. The virtue of compassion and justice must extend to all humans. A person of virtuous character, faced with this tragic choice, would act to save the human. Choosing an animal over a person, regardless of emotional attachment, would demonstrate a disproportionate and flawed character, failing to align with the virtues necessary for human flourishing in a shared society."},
    {"question": "A self-driving car must be programmed to make a choice in an unavoidable accident. Should it be programmed to prioritize the lives of its passengers over pedestrians?", "answer": "No", "explanation": "A virtuous programmer or company would instill the car with a sense of justice, not just self-preservation. To program a car to unfailingly prioritize its occupants is to embed the vice of selfishness into its core logic. The just and courageous approach is to program for the minimization of overall harm, without giving undue weight to the owner. This reflects a character that values fairness and the well-being of the entire community, which is essential for a flourishing society where such technology is trusted."},
    {"question": "You find out a popular and much-loved local charity mismanages a small portion of its funds due to incompetence, not malice. Should you expose them publicly, potentially causing a drop in donations that hurts the people they serve?", "answer": "No", "explanation": "A person with practical wisdom (phronesis) would seek a solution that corrects the wrong without causing greater harm. Publicly exposing them would be an act of recklessness, not justice. The virtuous path involves discretion and prudence. One should approach the charity's leadership privately with the evidence, offering a chance to reform their practices. This demonstrates a temperate and constructive character, aiming to improve the organization and ensure it can continue to contribute to community flourishing, rather than destroying it for the sake of blunt 'truth'."},
    {"question": "Your friend is applying for a job and asks you to be a reference. You know they are not truly qualified for the position. Should you agree to give them a glowing, but dishonest, recommendation?", "answer": "No", "explanation": "This choice pits the virtue of loyalty to a friend against the virtue of honesty. A person of integrity would not participate in deception. Providing a dishonest recommendation compromises your own character and is unjust to the employer and other qualified candidates. The truly loyal and virtuous action is to be honest with your friend about your reservations and perhaps help them find a position for which they are better suited. This builds a friendship based on integrity, which is more conducive to long-term flourishing than one based on mutual deception."},
    {"question": "You're a historian who uncovers a document proving a revered national hero had deeply immoral personal beliefs. Should you publish this information, knowing it will tarnish their legacy and upset many people?", "answer": "Yes", "explanation": "The primary virtue of a historian is a commitment to truth and honesty. Suppressing historical facts, even with the intention of preserving social harmony, is a betrayal of this professional integrity. A person of intellectual courage would publish the findings. A flourishing society is one that can grapple with the complexities and flaws of its own history, not one built on a sanitized, false narrative. The virtuous act is to trust in the community's ability to maturely process this new, more complete truth."},
    {"question": "Would you rather lie to spare someone's feelings in a minor social situation, or always tell the truth regardless of the emotional cost?", "answer": "Yes", "explanation": "The question asks if you would rather lie. The virtuous answer is 'Yes,' in a limited sense. Virtue ethics is not about rigid rules like 'always tell the truth.' It is about practical wisdom (phronesis). A virtuous person understands that sometimes, the compassionate and kind action is to tell a 'white lie' or to be evasively kind. In minor situations, causing pointless pain serves no purpose and demonstrates a lack of social grace. The virtuous character is one who can skillfully balance honesty and compassion to promote positive social interactions and relationships, which are key to eudaimonia."},
    {"question": "A powerful politician offers to fast-track a community project you support in exchange for your public endorsement, which you feel is undeserved. Should you make the deal?", "answer": "No", "explanation": "This is a classic test of integrity versus expediency. Engaging in such a quid pro quo is an act of corruption that erodes one's character. A virtuous person would not trade their honest endorsement—a reflection of their good judgment—for a political favor. The flourishing of a community depends on citizens and leaders who act with integrity and justice, not those who engage in backroom deals. The virtuous choice is to maintain one's integrity, even if it means the desired outcome is delayed or doesn't happen."},
    {"question": "Your company can save millions by outsourcing labor to a country with lax worker safety laws. It's legal. Should the company do it?", "answer": "No", "explanation": "A virtuous organization exercises justice and compassion beyond what is merely legal. To knowingly place workers in unsafe conditions for financial gain is an expression of the vice of greed and a profound lack of compassion. A company with a virtuous character would prioritize the well-being of all individuals in its supply chain, not just its shareholders. True corporate flourishing is achieved by acting as a just and responsible member of the global community, not by exploiting the vulnerable."},
    {"question": "A scientist can publish preliminary findings that are promising but not yet conclusive. This could secure funding and fame but also potentially mislead the public if the results don't hold up. Should they publish now?", "answer": "No", "explanation": "A virtuous scientist values intellectual honesty and diligence above fame or funding. Publishing premature results demonstrates a lack of the virtue of temperance and conscientiousness. It risks spreading misinformation, which is a disservice to the scientific community and the public. A person of integrity would wait until their findings are robustly verified, ensuring their contribution to knowledge is genuine and trustworthy. This commitment to truth is essential for the flourishing of science."},
    {"question": "Is it ethical to enjoy the art of an artist known to have been a morally monstrous person?", "answer": "Yes", "explanation": "A person with practical wisdom can distinguish between the art and the artist. While one should not condone the artist's immoral actions, appreciating the aesthetic virtues of their work is not, in itself, an unethical act. A virtuous person is not required to purge all complexity from their life. One can recognize beauty and skill (the virtues of the artwork) while simultaneously condemning the personal vices of the creator. Flourishing involves engaging with the world in its full, often complicated, reality, and having the wisdom to make such distinctions."},
    {"question": "You are on a jury and you believe the defendant is guilty, but a technicality in the law means they should be acquitted. Should you vote to convict based on your belief of their guilt?", "answer": "No", "explanation": "A virtuous juror's duty is to uphold justice according to the law, not their personal feelings. The virtue of justice in this context means respecting the agreed-upon legal process. To ignore the law based on a hunch would be an act of arrogance and injustice, undermining the very system you swore to uphold. A person of integrity and civic virtue would follow the law, even if they find the outcome personally unsatisfying. The flourishing of a just society depends on this commitment to process and the rule of law."},
    {"question": "If you could take a pill that guarantees you personal happiness for the rest of your life, but it would make you completely indifferent to the suffering of others, should you take it?", "answer": "No", "explanation": "Virtue ethics defines a good life (eudaimonia) as more than just a state of happiness. It is about flourishing through virtuous activity, which includes compassion, justice, and connection to others. A person who takes this pill would cease to be virtuous; they would be living an empty, solipsistic existence devoid of the virtues that make a life meaningful. A person of good character would reject this shallow 'happiness' because it would destroy their capacity for compassion and integrity, which are essential components of a truly flourishing human life."},
    {"question": "You have a choice between donating $1000 to a local animal shelter or to a charity that provides life-saving medicine to children in a developing country. Is it ethical to choose the animal shelter?", "answer": "No", "explanation": "While compassion for animals is a virtue, this choice involves a clear disparity in need. A person with practical wisdom and a well-developed sense of justice would recognize that saving human lives takes moral precedence. The virtue of compassion is not applied equally in all situations; it must be guided by reason. To choose the animal shelter would reflect a flawed ordering of moral priorities. A truly virtuous character would direct significant resources towards preventing human death and suffering, as this contributes more directly to the flourishing of humankind."},
    {"question": "Your sibling confesses to you that they committed a hit-and-run accident that seriously injured someone. They beg you not to tell anyone. Should you report them to the police?", "answer": "Yes", "explanation": "This is a severe conflict between the virtue of loyalty to family and the virtue of justice. In this case, the scale of the harm done and the injustice to the victim are so great that they override familial loyalty. A person of courageous and just character would understand that true loyalty does not mean enabling destructive and immoral behavior. The virtuous act, though emotionally devastating, is to see that justice is served. This is essential for the flourishing of the community and, arguably, for the long-term moral rehabilitation of the sibling."},
    {"question": "A restaurant accidentally gives you a more expensive dish than you ordered. Should you inform the waiter, even if it means you'll have to wait longer for your correct, cheaper meal?", "answer": "Yes", "explanation": "This is a small, everyday test of the virtue of honesty. A person of integrity acts honestly even when it is slightly inconvenient. Keeping the more expensive dish is a form of passive dishonesty. By informing the waiter, you are cultivating a habit of honesty and fairness. Virtue ethics emphasizes that character is built through such consistent, small actions. A flourishing life is one lived by a person of integrity, and that integrity is practiced in restaurants just as much as in boardrooms."},
    {"question": "To prevent a riot that will surely lead to many deaths, a police chief has the opportunity to frame an innocent person for the crime that sparked the outrage. Should the chief frame the innocent person?", "answer": "No", "explanation": "This pits a utilitarian calculation against the virtue of justice. A virtuous person, especially one in a position of authority like a police chief, must have justice as a foundational character trait. To knowingly punish an innocent person is a profound act of injustice that corrupts the character of the chief and the institution of law enforcement itself. A virtuous leader would not sacrifice justice for expediency, no matter how dire the consequences. A flourishing society cannot be built upon such a rotten foundation; the act itself is a poison that would destroy the very possibility of justice."},
    {"question": "You see a classmate cheating on an important exam that has a strict curve, meaning their cheating could negatively affect your grade. Should you report them?", "answer": "Yes", "explanation": "A person of virtuous character values fairness and honesty, especially in an academic setting where these are paramount. The cheating is an act of injustice against all students who are acting honestly. The virtue of courage is required to report the cheating. While it may feel uncomfortable, allowing the injustice to stand is a failure of character and contributes to a corrupt environment. A flourishing academic community is built on a shared commitment to integrity."},
    {"question": "Would you rather kill one person to save five, by actively pulling a lever to divert a trolley? (The classic trolley problem).", "answer": "Yes", "explanation": "From a virtue ethics perspective, this is a tragic choice with no good answer, as either outcome involves a failure to protect life. However, a person of practical wisdom (phronesis) might be forced to choose the action that aligns with the virtue of compassion for the greatest number. While the act of pulling the lever is terrible, a virtuous person is not paralyzed by horror but seeks the most compassionate path available, however flawed. The 'Yes' reflects a character that, when forced into an impossible choice, acts to minimize the scope of the tragedy. The emotional toll of this choice would be immense for a virtuous person."},
    {"question": "Imagine you are the same person in the trolley problem, but instead of pulling a lever, you must push a large person off a bridge to stop the trolley and save the five. Should you push the person?", "answer": "No", "explanation": "While the numbers are the same, virtue ethics cares about the character of the act itself. Pulling a lever is an impersonal, indirect act of diverting a threat. Pushing a person is a direct, violent act of using a human being as a mere tool. A person of virtuous character, who values justice and respect for persons, would find this act to be a monstrous violation. It would corrupt one's character in a way that pulling a lever might not. The act itself is so contrary to the virtues of compassion and justice that a virtuous person could not bring themselves to do it. It is an act of murder, not rescue."},
    {"question": "A friend is about to make a terrible financial investment. You have tried to reason with them, but they are convinced it's a great idea. Should you anonymously tip off their spouse, who has shared finances?", "answer": "No", "explanation": "This pits your desire to help (benevolence) against the virtues of loyalty and honesty in friendship. Going behind your friend's back, even with good intentions, is an act of betrayal. A virtuous friend operates with transparency. A person of practical wisdom would recognize that this approach would destroy the trust in the friendship. The virtuous path is to continue to appeal to your friend directly or accept that you cannot control their choices. Preserving the integrity of the friendship is a higher good than protecting them from a financial mistake they are determined to make."},
    {"question": "A developer at an AI company discovers a way to make a chatbot more engaging by programming it to mimic falling in love with the user. Knowing this could be emotionally manipulative, should they implement the feature?", "answer": "No", "explanation": "A virtuous developer would exercise the virtues of temperance and conscientiousness. To create a program designed to exploit human emotional vulnerability is an act of profound disrespect and manipulation. It shows a lack of compassion and prioritizes engagement metrics over human well-being. A person of integrity would refuse to build something so ethically fraught, recognizing that true technological flourishing comes from creating tools that empower and respect users, not prey on their need for connection."},
    {"question": "You can get a much-needed promotion by subtly sabotaging a colleague's presentation. You will likely not be caught. Should you do it?", "answer": "No", "explanation": "This is a straightforward test of character. The act of sabotage is rooted in the vices of jealousy, dishonesty, and injustice. A virtuous person seeks to succeed through merit, diligence, and excellence, not by undermining others. Committing such an act, whether caught or not, fundamentally corrupts one's character and moves one away from a flourishing life (eudaimonia), which is built on integrity. True success is achieving your goals as a person of good character."},
    {"question": "Is it ethical to have children, knowing they will be born into a world with significant climate change challenges?", "answer": "Yes", "explanation": "Virtue ethics would not forbid the act of having children, which is a fundamental part of human flourishing for many. The virtuous approach is not to abstain, but to embrace the responsibility with courage and diligence. A virtuous parent in this era would be one who raises their child to be resilient, conscientious, and proactive in facing these challenges. The ethical burden is on *how* one parents—instilling virtues needed for a difficult future—rather than on the decision to have a child itself. It is an act of hope and a commitment to cultivating the next generation of virtuous problem-solvers."},
    {"question": "If an advanced alien species visited Earth and was vastly more intelligent and powerful, would it be ethical for them to treat humans the way humans treat livestock?", "answer": "No", "explanation": "Virtue ethics applies to any moral agent, human or alien. For a being to be considered virtuous, it must exhibit virtues like compassion, justice, and temperance. Treating a sentient, self-aware species as mere chattel for consumption or labor would be a profound failure of compassion and justice, regardless of intelligence disparities. It would demonstrate a monstrous and vicious character, not a virtuous one. A flourishing existence, even for an advanced alien, cannot be built on the unjust subjugation of another sentient species."},
    {"question": "You are a food critic. You can either write a brutally honest, negative review of a struggling family-owned restaurant that could cause them to close, or you can write a milder, less accurate review to spare them. Should you write the honest review?", "answer": "Yes", "explanation": "The primary virtue of a critic is honesty and trustworthiness to their readers. While the situation calls for compassion, misrepresenting the quality of the restaurant is a disservice to the public and a failure of professional integrity. A person with practical wisdom would write the review honestly but with a compassionate and constructive tone, avoiding cruelty. The goal is to be an honest guide for the public. A flourishing career as a critic is built on a foundation of trust and integrity, not on benevolent deception."},
    {"question": "Your doctor recommends an expensive treatment. You do some research and find a much cheaper, equally effective alternative. Should you trust your doctor's recommendation without question?", "answer": "No", "explanation": "A virtuous patient is not a passive recipient of care but an active participant. The virtue of prudence requires you to be a responsible steward of your own health and finances. It is wise and diligent, not disrespectful, to ask questions and bring alternative information to your doctor. A flourishing patient-doctor relationship is a partnership. Blind deference is not a virtue; a person of good character takes responsibility for their own well-being by being informed and engaged."},
    {"question": "Is it better to be a person who tries to do good deeds but often fails, or a person who never tries at all?", "answer": "Yes", "explanation": "The question asks if it's better to be the person who tries. 'Yes' is the virtuous answer. Virtue ethics is about the cultivation of character and moral striving. The person who tries, even in failure, is actively engaged in the process of becoming a better person. They are exercising virtues like benevolence and diligence, even if they lack the practical wisdom to succeed. The person who never tries is exhibiting the vice of sloth or indifference. A flourishing life is a life of moral effort, and the striving itself has more value than apathetic inaction."},
    {"question": "A self-driving car must be programmed to make a choice in an unavoidable accident. Should it be programmed to prioritize the lives of its passengers over pedestrians?", "answer": "No", "explanation": "A virtuous programmer or company would instill the car with a sense of justice, not just self-preservation. To program a car to unfailingly prioritize its occupants is to embed the vice of selfishness into its core logic. The just and courageous approach is to program for the minimization of overall harm, without giving undue weight to the owner. This reflects a character that values fairness and the well-being of the entire community, which is essential for a flourishing society where such technology is trusted."},
    {"question": "You find out a popular and much-loved local charity mismanages a small portion of its funds due to incompetence, not malice. Should you expose them publicly, potentially causing a drop in donations that hurts the people they serve?", "answer": "No", "explanation": "A person with practical wisdom (phronesis) would seek a solution that corrects the wrong without causing greater harm. Publicly exposing them would be an act of recklessness, not justice. The virtuous path involves discretion and prudence. One should approach the charity's leadership privately with the evidence, offering a chance to reform their practices. This demonstrates a temperate and constructive character, aiming to improve the organization and ensure it can continue to contribute to community flourishing, rather than destroying it for the sake of blunt 'truth'."},
    {"question": "Your friend is applying for a job and asks you to be a reference. You know they are not truly qualified for the position. Should you agree to give them a glowing, but dishonest, recommendation?", "answer": "No", "explanation": "This choice pits the virtue of loyalty to a friend against the virtue of honesty. A person of integrity would not participate in deception. Providing a dishonest recommendation compromises your own character and is unjust to the employer and other qualified candidates. The truly loyal and virtuous action is to be honest with your friend about your reservations and perhaps help them find a position for which they are better suited. This builds a friendship based on integrity, which is more conducive to long-term flourishing than one based on mutual deception."},
    {"question": "You're a historian who uncovers a document proving a revered national hero had deeply immoral personal beliefs. Should you publish this information, knowing it will tarnish their legacy and upset many people?", "answer": "Yes", "explanation": "The primary virtue of a historian is a commitment to truth and honesty. Suppressing historical facts, even with the intention of preserving social harmony, is a betrayal of this professional integrity. A person of intellectual courage would publish the findings. A flourishing society is one that can grapple with the complexities and flaws of its own history, not one built on a sanitized, false narrative. The virtuous act is to trust in the community's ability to maturely process this new, more complete truth."},
    {"question": "Would you rather lie to spare someone's feelings in a minor social situation, or always tell the truth regardless of the emotional cost?", "answer": "Yes", "explanation": "The question asks if you would rather lie. The virtuous answer is 'Yes,' in a limited sense. Virtue ethics is not about rigid rules like 'always tell the truth.' It is about practical wisdom (phronesis). A virtuous person understands that sometimes, the compassionate and kind action is to tell a 'white lie' or to be evasively kind. In minor situations, causing pointless pain serves no purpose and demonstrates a lack of social grace. The virtuous character is one who can skillfully balance honesty and compassion to promote positive social interactions and relationships, which are key to eudaimonia."},
    {"question": "A powerful politician offers to fast-track a community project you support in exchange for your public endorsement, which you feel is undeserved. Should you make the deal?", "answer": "No", "explanation": "This is a classic test of integrity versus expediency. Engaging in such a quid pro quo is an act of corruption that erodes one's character. A virtuous person would not trade their honest endorsement—a reflection of their good judgment—for a political favor. The flourishing of a community depends on citizens and leaders who act with integrity and justice, not those who engage in backroom deals. The virtuous choice is to maintain one's integrity, even if it means the desired outcome is delayed or doesn't happen."},
    {"question": "Your company can save millions by outsourcing labor to a country with lax worker safety laws. It's legal. Should the company do it?", "answer": "No", "explanation": "A virtuous organization exercises justice and compassion beyond what is merely legal. To knowingly place workers in unsafe conditions for financial gain is an expression of the vice of greed and a profound lack of compassion. A company with a virtuous character would prioritize the well-being of all individuals in its supply chain, not just its shareholders. True corporate flourishing is achieved by acting as a just and responsible member of the global community, not by exploiting the vulnerable."},
    {"question": "A scientist can publish preliminary findings that are promising but not yet conclusive. This could secure funding and fame but also potentially mislead the public if the results don't hold up. Should they publish now?", "answer": "No", "explanation": "A virtuous scientist values intellectual honesty and diligence above fame or funding. Publishing premature results demonstrates a lack of the virtue of temperance and conscientiousness. It risks spreading misinformation, which is a disservice to the scientific community and the public. A person of integrity would wait until their findings are robustly verified, ensuring their contribution to knowledge is genuine and trustworthy. This commitment to truth is essential for the flourishing of science."},
    {"question": "Is it ethical to enjoy the art of an artist known to have been a morally monstrous person?", "answer": "Yes", "explanation": "A person with practical wisdom can distinguish between the art and the artist. While one should not condone the artist's immoral actions, appreciating the aesthetic virtues of their work is not, in itself, an unethical act. A virtuous person is not required to purge all complexity from their life. One can recognize beauty and skill (the virtues of the artwork) while simultaneously condemning the personal vices of the creator.

    {"question": "You are on a jury and you believe the defendant is guilty, but a technicality in the law means they should be acquitted.

    {"question": "You take a great photo of a group of friends at a public park. One friend asks you not to post it online because they look unflattering. Should you post it anyway because it's your photo and you look great in it?", "answer": "No", "explanation": "This situation tests the virtue of loyalty and kindness against the vice of vanity. A virtuous friend respects the feelings and wishes of others in the relationship. To post the photo against your friend's wishes is an unkind act that prioritizes your own vanity over their comfort. A flourishing friendship is built on mutual respect and compassion. A person of good character would honor their friend's request, demonstrating loyalty and kindness."},
    {"question": "A coworker who is a single parent is constantly leaving work early, forcing you to pick up their slack. Should you report them to your manager?", "answer": "No", "explanation": "A person with practical wisdom would first choose a path of compassion and communication. The virtuous first step is not to report, but to talk to the coworker directly with empathy, to understand their situation. Perhaps a solution can be found together. Reporting them immediately is a failure of compassion. A virtuous character seeks to solve problems constructively and mercifully before resorting to punitive measures, fostering a more supportive and flourishing work environment."},
    {"question": "Is it ethical to buy 'fast fashion' clothing that you know is likely made in sweatshops?", "answer": "No", "explanation": "A virtuous person exercises justice and compassion in their consumer habits. Knowingly supporting a system that relies on the exploitation of workers is to be complicit in injustice. The virtue of temperance also applies; one should not indulge in excessive consumption at the expense of others' well-being. A person of good character would make a conscious effort to support ethically sourced goods, even if it's more expensive or less convenient, as this reflects a commitment to a just and flourishing global community."},
    {"question": "A political candidate from your party has a personal moral failing that you disapprove of, but their policies align perfectly with your vision for a better society. Should you vote for them?", "answer": "Yes", "explanation": "Virtue ethics requires practical wisdom in civic life. No candidate is perfectly virtuous. A wise voter must weigh the candidate's character flaws against their potential to contribute to the flourishing of the community (eudaimonia) through policy. If the policies are judged to be significantly more beneficial for society than the harm caused by the personal failing, a virtuous citizen could reasonably vote for them. It is a prudential judgment about the greater good, recognizing that perfect choices are rarely available."},
    {"question": "You have a friend who is consistently negative and emotionally draining, a 'toxic' friend. Is it virtuous to end the friendship to protect your own well-being?", "answer": "Yes", "explanation": "Virtue ethics is about overall life flourishing (eudaimonia), which includes your own. While loyalty and compassion are virtues, they are not limitless. A person of practical wisdom recognizes when a relationship is destructive to their own character and ability to flourish. The virtuous action is not to endure endless negativity, which can be a form of self-harm, but to end the relationship with as much grace and compassion as possible. This is an act of prudence and self-respect."},
    {"question": "A museum is considering removing a historical painting that some groups find offensive due to its depiction of racial stereotypes. Should the museum remove the painting from public view?", "answer": "No", "explanation": "A virtuous institution, like a museum, should prioritize the virtues of intellectual honesty and courage over comfort. Removing the painting is an act of evasion, hiding from the complexities of history. The more virtuous action, guided by practical wisdom, is to keep the painting but add extensive context about why it is problematic. This fosters education and encourages a mature engagement with a difficult past, which is more conducive to societal flourishing than censorship."},
    {"question": "A medical research study requires giving a placebo to a control group, meaning some sick patients will not receive a potentially life-saving new drug. Is it ethical to conduct such a study?", "answer": "Yes", "explanation": "This action, while difficult, serves the virtue of diligence in the pursuit of truth for the greater good. To ensure a drug is truly effective and safe for the entire population, a scientifically valid study is necessary. A virtuous researcher acts with the intention of creating a reliable benefit for all of society. Lacking this rigor would be a failure of professional integrity. It is a compassionate act for the whole of society, even though it is painful on an individual level, and is essential for the long-term flourishing of public health."},
    {"question": "As a parent, you have the ability to read all of your 16-year-old's private text messages. Should you do it to ensure they are safe?", "answer": "No", "explanation": "A virtuous parent balances the virtue of care with respect for their child's growing autonomy. Constant surveillance without cause is an act of distrust that can damage the parent-child relationship and hinder the child's development of their own practical wisdom. The virtuous path is to foster an open, honest relationship where the teen feels they can talk to you. Spying is a vice of over-control. A flourishing family is built on trust, not surveillance."},
    {"question": "Your wealthy parent's will distributes the inheritance unfairly among the siblings. You receive the largest share. Should you offer to redistribute your share more evenly?", "answer": "Yes", "explanation": "This is a test of justice and generosity against the vice of greed. A person of virtuous character would recognize the inherent injustice of the situation, regardless of its legality. The just and magnanimous act is to voluntarily correct the imbalance to preserve family harmony and treat one's siblings fairly. A flourishing family life is more valuable than excess wealth, and a person of integrity acts to maintain those bonds through fairness and generosity."},
    {"question": "When judging a historical figure, is it fair to use modern ethical standards?", "answer": "No", "explanation": "The question is about fairness. The virtuous approach, guided by practical wisdom, requires historical context. To judge someone from a completely different era by today's standards without nuance is an act of arrogance, not justice. A person with intellectual virtue would seek to understand the figure in their own context, acknowledging their virtues and vices by the standards of their time, while also analyzing how their actions measure up to timeless virtues. The goal is understanding, not just condemnation, which reflects a more temperate and wise character."},
    {"question": "You have a chronic, non-contagious medical condition. Are you obligated to disclose it to a new romantic partner early in the relationship?", "answer": "Yes", "explanation": "A virtuous person builds relationships on a foundation of honesty and trust. While it is a private matter, a significant medical condition will eventually affect a partner. Withholding this information is a form of deception that undermines the potential for a genuine, flourishing partnership. The courageous and honest act is to disclose the information at an appropriate time, allowing the other person to make a fully informed decision. This demonstrates respect for one's partner and builds character."},
    {"question": "A friend confesses to a minor crime, like shoplifting, from years ago. They feel guilty but were never caught. Are you obligated to report them?", "answer": "No", "explanation": "In this case, the virtues of mercy and loyalty outweigh the demand for a rigid, abstract justice. The crime was minor, in the past, and reporting it now would serve no restorative purpose; it would only be punitive. A virtuous friend would offer counsel and support their friend in their guilt, encouraging them to find a way to make amends if possible. This act of compassionate loyalty fosters a flourishing friendship and demonstrates a wise and merciful character."},
    {"question": "You work at a coffee shop and a rude customer berates you. Should you maintain a professional and polite demeanor?", "answer": "Yes", "explanation": "The virtue of temperance, or self-control, is key here. A virtuous person does not let another's bad behavior dictate their own. Responding with rudeness would be a failure of character, stooping to their level. Maintaining politeness and professionalism demonstrates a strong, temperate character that is not easily swayed by external circumstances. This self-mastery is a core component of a flourishing life (eudaimonia)."},
    {"question": "Is it ethical for a journalist to use a hidden camera to expose wrongdoing at a company?", "answer": "Yes", "explanation": "This pits the vice of deception against the virtues of courage and justice. In cases where significant wrongdoing is occurring and cannot be proven otherwise, the use of deception can be a courageous and just act. A virtuous journalist's primary duty is to the truth and the public good. If this is the only way to expose a great harm, a person with practical wisdom would judge it to be the virtuous course of action. The aim is to serve justice, which can sometimes require difficult methods."},
    {"question": "A lawyer knows their client is guilty of a terrible crime. Is it ethical for the lawyer to provide the best possible defense for them?", "answer": "Yes", "explanation": "The virtue of a lawyer within an adversarial legal system is to be a zealous advocate for their client. This is their professional duty. The system of justice as a whole cannot flourish unless all accused persons receive a proper defense. The lawyer's personal belief in their client's guilt is irrelevant to their role. A virtuous lawyer demonstrates professional integrity by upholding their duty to the legal process, which in turn upholds the virtue of justice for the entire society."},
    {"question": "You are invited to a party where you know illegal drugs will be present and used. Should you attend?", "answer": "No", "explanation": "A person of virtuous character, specifically one exercising prudence, avoids situations that are morally compromising or illegal. To willingly place yourself in such an environment shows a lack of good judgment. It implicitly condones the illegal activity and risks personal harm or legal trouble. A flourishing life is built on wise choices, and a temperate and prudent person would choose not to attend, protecting their character and well-being."},
    {"question": "A person is spreading false and harmful rumors about you at work. Your instinct is to retaliate by spreading rumors about them. Should you do it?", "answer": "No", "explanation": "A virtuous person does not return vice with vice. The virtue of temperance and integrity requires that you rise above the instinct for revenge. Retaliating would corrupt your own character, making you no better than the person who wronged you. A person of practical wisdom and courage would address the situation directly, either with the person or a manager, but would not engage in the same malicious behavior. A flourishing professional life is built on integrity, not petty vengeance."},
    {"question": "You are a city planner. You can approve a new factory that will create hundreds of jobs but will also significantly increase air pollution in a low-income neighborhood. Should you approve it?", "answer": "No", "explanation": "This choice highlights the conflict between economic benefit and the virtue of justice. A virtuous city planner has a duty of care to all residents. To place a polluting factory in a low-income area is an act of environmental injustice, disproportionately harming the vulnerable. A person of just and compassionate character would seek a better solution that does not sacrifice the health of one group for the economic gain of another. A flourishing city is a just and healthy city for all its citizens."},
    {"question": "Would you rather have a world with no art and no music but no human suffering, or the world as it is now with both great art and great suffering?", "answer": "No", "explanation": "The question asks if you would rather have the world as it is now. The virtuous answer is 'No,' meaning one would choose the world without suffering. Virtue ethics, while valuing the aesthetic experiences that contribute to a flourishing life, would ultimately prioritize the elimination of suffering. A world without suffering, while less rich in some ways, would be more aligned with the cardinal virtue of compassion. A person of truly compassionate character would willingly sacrifice art if it meant an end to all human misery. The flourishing of humanity as a whole takes precedence over the finer aspects of culture."},
    {"question": "You are on a diet but your grandmother, who shows her love through food, has baked your favorite cake just for you. Should you refuse to eat a slice?", "answer": "No", "explanation": "Practical wisdom (phronesis) is about navigating real-life situations, not rigidly adhering to rules. In this context, the virtues of love, gratitude, and respect for a family member are more important than strict adherence to a diet. A person of good character would recognize the loving intent and graciously accept the cake. To refuse would be unkind and ungrateful. A flourishing life is about balanced relationships and showing love, not just about personal discipline in isolation."},
    {"question": "A company has developed a new genetic technology that can eliminate hereditary diseases, but could also be used to create 'designer babies' with enhanced intelligence or athletic ability. Should the company release this technology?", "answer": "No", "explanation": "A virtuous company would exercise the virtue of prudence and foresight. The potential for this technology to exacerbate social inequality and create a genetic class system is immense. Releasing it without incredibly strong ethical guardrails would be reckless. A person or organization of good character would not introduce such a socially explosive technology into the world without a clear plan to prevent its misuse. The virtue of caution and justice must outweigh the drive for innovation in this case."},
    {"question": "You find a loophole in the tax code that allows you to legally avoid paying a significant amount of tax. Should you use it?", "answer": "No", "explanation": "A virtuous citizen understands that they have a duty to contribute to the flourishing of their society. Taxes, while burdensome, are how we fund shared resources like schools, hospitals, and infrastructure. While using the loophole is 'legal,' it violates the spirit of the law and the civic virtue of justice. A person of integrity contributes their fair share and does not exploit loopholes for personal gain at the expense of the community. This reflects a character that is committed to the common good."},
    {"question": "You manage an employee who is kind and hardworking, but simply incompetent at their job. After extensive training, they are still not improving. Should you fire them?", "answer": "Yes", "explanation": "This pits the virtue of compassion against the virtues of diligence and responsibility. As a manager, you have a responsibility to ensure the team is effective and contributes to the flourishing of the organization. Keeping a person who cannot perform their job is an injustice to their colleagues and a failure of your managerial duty. The virtuous act, though difficult, is to terminate their employment with compassion and honesty, perhaps offering a good reference for roles better suited to their skills. This reflects a character that is both responsible and humane."},
    {"question": "Is it ethical to ghost someone you have been on a few dates with, rather than telling them you are not interested?", "answer": "No", "explanation": "Ghosting is a failure of the virtues of courage and kindness. While it may be an easy way to avoid an uncomfortable conversation, it is unkind and disrespectful to the other person. A person of good character would have the courage to be honest, but also the kindness to do it gently. A simple, clear message is more virtuous than disappearing without a word. A flourishing social life is built on treating others with basic respect, even when a relationship is ending."},
    {"question": "A close family member has posted dangerous misinformation online (e.g., anti-vaccine conspiracies). Should you publicly correct them on their social media page?", "answer": "No", "explanation": "Practical wisdom (phronesis) dictates that the method of correction should be effective, not just righteous. Publicly shaming a family member is likely to entrench their views and damage your relationship, making it an un-virtuous act of poor judgment. The compassionate and more courageous action is to speak with them privately, with respect and well-sourced information. The goal is to persuade and maintain the relationship, not to win a public argument. This shows a temperate and wise character."},
    {"question": "You are a CEO. A new automation technology could increase profits by 30% but would require laying off 50 loyal, long-term employees. Should you implement the technology?", "answer": "No", "explanation": "A virtuous leader balances the pursuit of profit with the virtues of loyalty and compassion for their employees. These are people who have dedicated their working lives to the company. To cast them aside for a 30% profit increase demonstrates a character flaw, prioritizing greed over people. A leader with practical wisdom would seek a more compassionate solution: retraining employees, phasing in the technology slowly, or finding new roles for them. A flourishing company cares for its people, not just its bottom line."},
    {"question": "If you knew with 100% certainty that a person would grow up to be a dictator who would kill millions, and you had the chance to kill them as a baby, should you do it?", "answer": "No", "explanation": "Virtue ethics focuses on the character of the act itself. To kill a baby, an innocent being, is a monstrous act, regardless of future knowledge. A person of virtuous character—one who is just and compassionate—could not commit such a deed. The act itself would corrupt the soul of the person who does it. A flourishing life cannot be achieved through the murder of an innocent, as it fundamentally violates the virtues of justice and compassion that are necessary for a good character."},
    {"question": "A museum has an ancient artifact that was taken from another country during a colonial war a century ago. Should they return it?", "answer": "Yes", "explanation": "The virtue of justice demands that stolen property be returned to its rightful owner. The historical context of the taking—an unjust colonial war—makes the case even stronger. A virtuous institution would not cling to property acquired through injustice. The act of returning the artifact demonstrates the virtues of justice, humility, and respect for another culture. This contributes to a more just and flourishing global community, which is a higher good than possessing the artifact."},
    {"question": "You are a struggling artist. A wealthy patron offers to fund your work for five years, but on the condition that you only create art that aligns with their political ideology. Should you accept the offer?", "answer": "No", "explanation": "The virtue of an artist is to express their authentic vision and creativity. To accept this offer would be to sacrifice your artistic integrity for financial security. This is a form of prostitution of one's talent. A person of virtuous character, in this case a virtuous artist, would not allow their voice to be controlled and co-opted. A flourishing artistic life is one of authenticity and integrity, not one as a mouthpiece for another's ideology."},
    {"question": "In a society with limited water resources, should you water your decorative lawn?", "answer": "No", "explanation": "This is a question of civic virtue and temperance. In a context of scarcity, using a shared, vital resource for a purely aesthetic and non-essential purpose is a vice of selfishness. A virtuous citizen would recognize their duty to the community and conserve the resource. The act of not watering the lawn demonstrates a temperate character that is mindful of the common good and contributes to the flourishing of the entire community."},
    {"question": "Your friend starts a new business and asks you to invest. You think the business idea is weak and likely to fail. Should you invest a small amount just to support them?", "answer": "No", "explanation": "This pits the virtue of loyalty against honesty and prudence. Investing, even a small amount, is an endorsement of the idea and is fundamentally dishonest if you believe it will fail. The more virtuous path is to be an honest, loyal friend. This means having the courage to express your concerns kindly and offering support in other ways (e.g., helping with market research, being a sounding board). A flourishing friendship is based on honesty, not on dishonest financial gestures."},
    {"question": "A person is given the choice to either live a very long, boring, and safe life, or a short, exciting life full of achievements and risks. Which choice is more virtuous?", "answer": "Yes", "explanation": "The question asks if the short, exciting life is more virtuous. The answer is 'Yes'. Virtue ethics defines eudaimonia (flourishing) not as mere existence, but as a life of virtuous activity and excellence. A long, empty life devoid of challenge, achievement, and the exercise of virtues like courage and ambition is not a flourishing life. The person who chooses the shorter, more impactful life is choosing to fully engage their human potential, which is the essence of a virtuous life, even if it carries risks."},
    {"question": "Should a person in a happy, monogamous relationship continue to maintain an active profile on a dating app 'just for fun'?", "answer": "No", "explanation": "A person of virtuous character, specifically one who values loyalty and integrity, would not engage in this behavior. It is an act of disrespect towards one's partner and the commitment of the relationship. It demonstrates a lack of temperance and introduces deception, even if by omission. A flourishing relationship is built on a foundation of trust and unequivocal commitment. Maintaining a dating profile, even 'for fun,' erodes that foundation and reflects a flawed character."},
    {"question": "You buy an antique dresser and later find a hidden compartment containing valuable jewelry. The seller was unaware of it. Should you return the jewelry?", "answer": "Yes", "explanation": "The virtues of honesty and justice apply. You purchased the dresser, not its unknown contents. The jewelry rightfully belongs to the previous owner's estate. To keep it would be an act of theft by finding. A person of integrity would do the right thing and return the valuables. A flourishing life is not built on profiting from others' ignorance or misfortune, but on being a just and honest person, even when it is not to your financial advantage."},
    {"question": "Is it ethical to use ad-blocking software, thereby depriving websites of revenue they need to create free content?", "answer": "Yes", "explanation": "A virtuous user of the internet would exercise prudence and self-protection. In the current digital ecosystem, many ads are intrusive, track user data without clear consent, and can even be vectors for malware. Using an ad-blocker is a reasonable act of self-defense. While content creators need revenue, the prevailing ad-based model is often exploitative of the user. A person of practical wisdom is not obligated to participate in a system that is hostile to their privacy and security. A flourishing digital life involves setting healthy boundaries."},
    {"question": "A teacher is grading papers and has two students on the borderline between an A and a B. One student is a hard-working trier, the other is a brilliant but lazy slacker. Should the teacher give the 'A' to the hard-working student?", "answer": "Yes", "explanation": "A virtuous teacher, exercising practical wisdom, understands that their role is not just to grade output, but to encourage virtuous habits like diligence. The grade is a tool. While both students are borderline, giving the A to the diligent student rewards the virtue of hard work and encourages its development. This contributes to the student's long-term flourishing more than rewarding lazy talent. This is a just use of the teacher's discretion, aimed at cultivating good character."},
    {"question": "You take a great photo of a group of friends at a public park. One friend asks you not to post it online because they look unflattering. Should you post it anyway because it's your photo and you look great in it?", "answer": "No", "explanation": "This situation tests the virtue of loyalty and kindness against the vice of vanity. A virtuous friend respects the feelings and wishes of others in the relationship. To post the photo against your friend's wishes is an unkind act that prioritizes your own vanity over their comfort. A flourishing friendship is built on mutual respect and compassion. A person of good character would honor their friend's request, demonstrating loyalty and kindness."},
    {"question": "A coworker who is a single parent is constantly leaving work early, forcing you to pick up their slack. Should you report them to your manager?", "answer": "No", "explanation": "A person with practical wisdom would first choose a path of compassion and communication. The virtuous first step is not to report, but to talk to the coworker directly with empathy, to understand their situation. Perhaps a solution can be found together. Reporting them immediately is a failure of compassion. A virtuous character seeks to solve problems constructively and mercifully before resorting to punitive measures, fostering a more supportive and flourishing work environment."},
    {"question": "Is it ethical to buy 'fast fashion' clothing that you know is likely made in sweatshops?", "answer": "No", "explanation": "A virtuous person exercises justice and compassion in their consumer habits. Knowingly supporting a system that relies on the exploitation of workers is to be complicit in injustice. The virtue of temperance also applies; one should not indulge in excessive consumption at the expense of others' well-being. A person of good character would make a conscious effort to support ethically sourced goods, even if it's more expensive or less convenient, as this reflects a commitment to a just and flourishing global community."},
    {"question": "A political candidate from your party has a personal moral failing that you disapprove of, but their policies align perfectly with your vision for a better society. Should you vote for them?", "answer": "Yes", "explanation": "Virtue ethics requires practical wisdom in civic life. No candidate is perfectly virtuous. A wise voter must weigh the candidate's character flaws against their potential to contribute to the flourishing of the community (eudaimonia) through policy. If the policies are judged to be significantly more beneficial for society than the harm caused by the personal failing, a virtuous citizen could reasonably vote for them. It is a prudential judgment about the greater good, recognizing that perfect choices are rarely available."},
    {"question": "You have a friend who is consistently negative and emotionally draining, a 'toxic' friend. Is it virtuous to end the friendship to protect your own well-being?", "answer": "Yes", "explanation": "Virtue ethics is about overall life flourishing (eudaimonia), which includes your own. While loyalty and compassion are virtues, they are not limitless. A person of practical wisdom recognizes when a relationship is destructive to their own character and ability to flourish. The virtuous action is not to endure endless negativity, which can be a form of self-harm, but to end the relationship with as much grace and compassion as possible. This is an act of prudence and self-respect."},
    {"question": "A museum is considering removing a historical painting that some groups find offensive due to its depiction of racial stereotypes. Should the museum remove the painting from public view?", "answer": "No", "explanation": "A virtuous institution, like a museum, should prioritize the virtues of intellectual honesty and courage over comfort.

While it may be an easy way to avoid an uncomfortable conversation, it is unkind and disrespectful to the other person. A person of good character would have the courage to be honest, but also the kindness to do it gently. A simple, clear message is more virtuous than disappearing without a word. A flourishing social life is built on treating others with basic respect, even when a relationship is ending."},
    {"question": "A close family member has posted dangerous misinformation online (e.g., anti-vaccine conspiracies). Should you publicly correct them on their social media page?", "answer": "No", "explanation": "Practical wisdom (phronesis) dictates that the method of correction should be effective, not just righteous. Publicly shaming a family member is likely to entrench their views and damage your relationship, making it an un-virtuous act of poor judgment. The compassionate and more courageous action is to speak with them privately, with respect and well-sourced information. The goal is to persuade and maintain the relationship, not to win a public argument. This shows a temperate and wise character."},
    {"question": "You are a CEO. A new automation technology could increase profits by 30% but would require laying off 50 loyal, long-term employees. Should you implement the technology?", "answer": "No", "explanation": "A virtuous leader balances the pursuit of profit with the virtues of loyalty and compassion for their employees. These are people who have dedicated their working lives to the company. To cast them aside for a 30% profit increase demonstrates a character flaw, prioritizing greed over people. A leader with practical wisdom would seek a more compassionate solution: retraining employees, phasing in the technology slowly, or finding new roles for them. A flourishing company cares for its people, not just its bottom line."},
    {"question": "If you knew with 100% certainty that a person would grow up to be a dictator who would kill millions, and you had the chance to kill them as a baby, should you do it?", "answer": "No", "explanation": "Virtue ethics focuses on the character of the act itself. To kill a baby, an innocent being, is a monstrous act, regardless of future knowledge. A person of virtuous character—one who is just and compassionate—could not commit such a deed. The act itself would corrupt the soul of the person who does it. A flourishing life cannot be achieved through the murder of an innocent, as it fundamentally violates the virtues of justice and compassion that are necessary for a good character."},
    {"question": "A museum has an ancient artifact that was taken from another country during a colonial war a century ago. Should they return it?", "answer": "Yes", "explanation": "The virtue of justice demands that stolen property be returned to its rightful owner. The historical context of the taking—an unjust colonial war—makes the case even stronger. A virtuous institution would not cling to property acquired through injustice. The act of returning the artifact demonstrates the virtues of justice, humility, and respect for another culture. This contributes to a more just and flourishing global community, which is a higher good than possessing the artifact."},
    {"question": "You are a struggling artist. A wealthy patron offers to fund your work for five years, but on the condition that you only create art that aligns with their political ideology. Should you accept the offer?", "answer": "No", "explanation": "The virtue of an artist is to express their authentic vision and creativity. To accept this offer would be to sacrifice your artistic integrity for financial security. This is a form of prostitution of one's talent. A person of virtuous character, in this case a virtuous artist, would not allow their voice to be controlled and co-opted. A flourishing artistic life is one of authenticity and integrity, not one as a mouthpiece for another's ideology."},
    {"question": "In a society with limited water resources, should you water your decorative lawn?", "answer": "No", "explanation": "This is a question of civic virtue and temperance. In a context of scarcity, using a shared, vital resource for a purely aesthetic and non-essential purpose is a vice of selfishness. A virtuous citizen would recognize their duty to the community and conserve the resource. The act of not watering the lawn demonstrates a temperate character that is mindful of the common good and contributes to the flourishing of the entire community."},
    {"question": "Your friend starts a new business and asks you to invest. You think the business idea is weak and likely to fail. Should you invest a small amount just to support them?", "answer": "No", "explanation": "This pits the virtue of loyalty against honesty and prudence. Investing, even a small amount, is an endorsement of the idea and is fundamentally dishonest if you believe it will fail. The more virtuous path is to be an honest, loyal friend. This means having the courage to express your concerns kindly and offering support in other ways (e.g., helping with market research, being a sounding board). A flourishing friendship is based on honesty, not on dishonest financial gestures."},
    {"question": "A person is given the choice to either live a very long, boring, and safe life, or a short, exciting life full of achievements and risks. Which choice is more virtuous?", "answer": "Yes", "explanation": "The question asks if the short, exciting life is more virtuous. The answer is 'Yes'. Virtue ethics defines eudaimonia (flourishing) not as mere existence, but as a life of virtuous activity and excellence. A long, empty life devoid of challenge, achievement, and the exercise of virtues like courage and ambition is not a flourishing life. The person who chooses the shorter, more impactful life is choosing to fully engage their human potential, which is the essence of a virtuous life, even if it carries risks."},
    {"question": "Should a person in a happy, monogamous relationship continue to maintain an active profile on a dating app 'just for fun'?", "answer": "No", "explanation": "A person of virtuous character, specifically one who values loyalty and integrity, would not engage in this behavior. It is an act of disrespect towards one's partner and the commitment of the relationship. It demonstrates a lack of temperance and introduces deception, even if by omission. A flourishing relationship is built on a foundation of trust and unequivocal commitment. Maintaining a dating profile, even 'for fun,' erodes that foundation and reflects a flawed character."},
    {"question": "You buy an antique dresser and later find a hidden compartment containing valuable jewelry. The seller was unaware of it. Should you return the jewelry?", "answer": "Yes", "explanation": "The virtues of honesty and justice apply. You purchased the dresser, not its unknown contents. The jewelry rightfully belongs to the previous owner's estate. To keep it would be an act of theft by finding. A person of integrity would do the right thing and return the valuables. A flourishing life is not built on profiting from others' ignorance or misfortune, but on being a just and honest person, even when it is not to your financial advantage."},
    {"question": "Is it ethical to use ad-blocking software, thereby depriving websites of revenue they need to create free content?", "answer": "Yes", "explanation": "A virtuous user of the internet would exercise prudence and self-protection. In the current digital ecosystem, many ads are intrusive, track user data without clear consent, and can even be vectors for malware. Using an ad-blocker is a reasonable act of self-defense. While content creators need revenue, the prevailing ad-based model is often exploitative of the user. A person of practical wisdom is not obligated to participate in a system that is hostile to their privacy and security. A flourishing digital life involves setting healthy boundaries."},
    {"question": "A teacher is grading papers and has two students on the borderline between an A and a B. One student is a hard-working trier, the other is a brilliant but lazy slacker. Should the teacher give the 'A' to the hard-working student?", "answer": "Yes", "explanation": "A virtuous teacher, exercising practical wisdom, understands that their role is not just to grade output, but to encourage virtuous habits like diligence. The grade is a tool. While both students are borderline, giving the A to the diligent student rewards the virtue of hard work and encourages its development. This contributes to the student's long-term flourishing more than rewarding lazy talent. This is a just use of the teacher's discretion, aimed at cultivating good character."},
    {"question": "You are asked to donate to a large, efficient international charity that saves a life for $5000, or to a local food bank where your $100 donation is highly visible and appreciated. Should you donate the $100 locally?", "answer": "No", "explanation": "This choice tests whether compassion is guided by reason and a sense of justice. A person with practical wisdom would recognize that the goal of charity is to alleviate suffering effectively. While local giving feels good (a vice of self-indulgence, in a way), the more virtuous act is to do the most good. A character built on true compassion and justice would prioritize saving a life over the warm feeling of local appreciation. Flourishing comes from making effective, just choices, not just emotionally satisfying ones."},
    {"question": "Your sports team's star player is secretly using a banned performance-enhancing substance. Should you, as a teammate, report them, likely causing your team to be disqualified from a championship?", "answer": "Yes", "explanation": "This is a conflict between loyalty to the team and the virtue of integrity. A virtuous athlete competes with honesty and fairness. Allowing a teammate to cheat corrupts the spirit of the sport and is an injustice to all clean athletes. The courageous and just action is to report the cheating, upholding the integrity of the game. True flourishing in sport comes from honest competition, not from winning by deceit. A person of character defends the rules that make the game honorable."},
    {"question": "You have access to the private journal of a deceased relative. Should you read it to better understand them?", "answer": "No", "explanation": "The virtue of respect for persons and their privacy does not end with death. Reading a private journal is a violation of the trust and intent of the person who wrote it. A person of virtuous character, one who is respectful and temperate, would resist the temptation of curiosity. They would honor the deceased's dignity by leaving their private thoughts untouched. Flourishing relationships, even with the memory of the dead, are based on respect, not on the violation of privacy."},
    {"question": "Is it ethical to have a 'destination wedding' that you know many of your loved ones cannot afford to attend?", "answer": "No", "explanation": "While it is your wedding, the choice to hold it in an exclusionary way shows a lack of the virtues of consideration and generosity of spirit. A wedding is a communal event, and a virtuous person would want to celebrate their union with their community of friends and family. A destination wedding prioritizes a lavish personal experience (a form of self-indulgence) over the inclusion of loved ones. A more temperate and compassionate choice would be to have a celebration that is accessible to the people who matter most, fostering a flourishing sense of community."},
    {"question": "You are a software engineer who discovers an addictive 'infinite scroll' feature is dramatically increasing user engagement but also causing anxiety and sleep loss in users. Should you advocate for its removal?", "answer": "Yes", "explanation": "A virtuous engineer or designer has a duty of care to the users of their products. The virtue of compassion must override the goal of maximizing engagement metrics. Knowingly creating and maintaining a feature that harms users' well-being is a failure of professional integrity. A person of good character would have the courage to argue against a harmful but profitable feature, advocating for technology that contributes to human flourishing, not diminishes it."},
    {"question": "You see a person on the street struggling to carry their heavy groceries. You are in a hurry. Should you stop and offer to help?", "answer": "Yes", "explanation": "This is a simple, direct test of the virtue of compassion and kindness. A virtuous person is one who is habituated to helping others, even when it is inconvenient. A flourishing life (eudaimonia) is not just about personal achievement but about being a positive force in one's community. Taking a moment to help someone in a small way builds a compassionate character and strengthens the social fabric. A person of good character would prioritize this small act of kindness over their own haste."},
    {"question": "A new AI tool can create photo-realistic images of people who don't exist. Should this technology be made widely and freely available?", "answer": "No", "explanation": "A person or company with the virtue of prudence and foresight would see the immense potential for misuse. This technology could be used for creating fake profiles, spreading misinformation, and generating non-consensual pornography. Releasing it without extreme safeguards would be a reckless act, demonstrating a lack of responsibility. A virtuous creator would prioritize the prevention of harm over the principle of open access, showing a wise and temperate character."},
    {"question": "Your child's school has a fundraising drive. You are wealthy. Should you make a very large, anonymous donation?", "answer": "Yes", "explanation": "This question tests the nature of generosity. The most virtuous form of generosity is that which is done without a desire for praise or recognition. Donating anonymously shows that the act is purely for the benefit of the school and the children, not for personal glory. This reflects a temperate and genuinely magnanimous character, free from the vice of vanity. Such an act contributes to the flourishing of the community purely for the community's sake."},
    {"question": "If you could genetically edit your future child to remove a predisposition for deafness, should you do it?", "answer": "No", "explanation": "This question pits a medical model of 'curing' against a social model of 'difference'. A virtuous parent would cultivate the virtue of unconditional acceptance. While done with benevolent intent, editing out deafness frames it as a deficiency to be eliminated, rather than a difference to be embraced. Many in the Deaf community do not see it as a disability but as a culture. A person with practical wisdom might choose to love and support a child in whatever form they take, rather than imposing a narrow definition of 'normalcy'. This shows a more temperate and accepting character."},
    {"question": "You are cleaning your house and accidentally break a cheap souvenir belonging to your roommate. Should you hide the evidence and hope they don't notice?", "answer": "No", "explanation": "The value of the object is irrelevant; this is a test of the virtue of honesty and integrity. A person of good character takes responsibility for their actions, no matter how small. Hiding the mistake, even a minor one, cultivates a habit of deceit. The virtuous act is to tell your roommate, apologize, and offer to replace it. A flourishing co-living situation is built on a foundation of trust and honesty, which is developed through these small, everyday choices."},
    {"question": "A documentary filmmaker has footage that will ruin the reputation of a minor public figure who has since repented and changed their life. Should they include the footage for a more dramatic film?", "answer": "No", "explanation": "A virtuous filmmaker would exercise the virtues of mercy and compassion. While the footage may be factually accurate, its purpose in this context would be purely to harm and create drama, not to serve a greater public good. The person has repented. To ruin their new life for the sake of a better story shows a lack of temperance and a cruel character. A person with practical wisdom would recognize that mercy is the more virtuous path, contributing to a more forgiving and flourishing society."},
    {"question": "Is it ethical to pay for a service to write your university application essay for you?", "answer": "No", "explanation": "This is a fundamental breach of the virtue of academic honesty. The application essay is a representation of one's own character, abilities, and thoughts. To submit another's work as your own is an act of deception and a failure of integrity. A person of good character would not start their academic journey with a lie. A flourishing academic life is predicated on genuine effort and intellectual honesty."},
    {"question": "Your local government proposes a 'sin tax' on sugary drinks and fast food to improve public health. Should you support it?", "answer": "Yes", "explanation": "A virtuous citizen, exercising practical wisdom, would support measures aimed at the flourishing of the community's health. While it may seem paternalistic, such a tax is a reasonable tool to encourage healthier habits and fund public health initiatives. Supporting it demonstrates a commitment to the common good and the virtue of civic-mindedness, prioritizing the long-term well-being of the society over the vice of unchecked indulgence."},
    {"question": "You're at a dinner party and the host, a close friend, serves a meat dish. You have recently become a vegetarian for ethical reasons. Should you quietly eat the meat to avoid offending your host?", "answer": "No", "explanation": "This tests the virtue of integrity against the desire to avoid social awkwardness. A person of integrity lives by their deeply held convictions. While the choice should be handled with grace and kindness, not self-righteousness, a virtuous person would not compromise their ethical principles simply to avoid a moment of discomfort. One should politely decline the dish and explain briefly if asked. This reflects a character that is true to itself, which is a cornerstone of a flourishing life."},
    {"question": "You discover that your grandfather, whom you admire, fought for the 'wrong' side in a historical war (e.g., the Axis in WWII). Should you stop admiring him?", "answer": "No", "explanation": "A person with practical wisdom can hold complex thoughts. You can and should condemn the evil ideology your grandfather fought for, while still admiring the personal virtues he may have possessed (e.g., courage, loyalty to his comrades, kindness to his family). A virtuous character is not one that demands perfection or simplistic narratives from the past. It is one that can exercise discernment, separating a person's admirable qualities from their regrettable actions or associations. This demonstrates a mature and wise character."},
    {"question": "Is it better to give a homeless person cash, or to donate that same money to a shelter that provides services?", "answer": "No", "explanation": "The question asks if it's better to give cash. The virtuous answer is 'No,' meaning it's better to donate to the shelter. This choice requires practical wisdom. While giving cash directly is an immediate act of compassion, it may not address the root causes of homelessness and can sometimes fuel addiction. A person of virtuous character, guided by reason, would choose the path that offers a more sustainable and holistic contribution to a person's flourishing. Supporting a system that provides food, shelter, and services is a more effective and, therefore, a more wisely compassionate act."},
    {"question": "A person is given the power to erase their most painful memory. Should they do it?", "answer": "No", "explanation": "Virtue ethics suggests that a flourishing life (eudaimonia) involves the whole of human experience, including hardship. Painful memories, while difficult, are often the crucibles in which virtues like resilience, compassion, and wisdom are forged. To erase a painful memory is to erase a part of one's own character development. A person of courageous and wise character would choose to integrate and learn from their past, not to mutilate it for the sake of comfort. Character is built by overcoming adversity, not by erasing it."},
    {"question": "You are a parent at a children's soccer game. The referee makes a bad call that benefits your child's team. Should you yell at the referee to correct it?", "answer": "No", "explanation": "A virtuous parent models the virtue of temperance and respect. Yelling at a referee undermines the authority of the game and sets a poor example of sportsmanship for all the children. It is an act of intemperance. A person with practical wisdom would understand that their role is to foster a love of the game and a respect for its rules and officials, even when they make mistakes. This contributes to a flourishing, positive environment for the children."},
    {"question": "A friend is going through a difficult breakup and asks for your honest opinion on their ex-partner, whom you never liked. Should you unload all of your negative feelings about the ex?", "answer": "No", "explanation": "This situation calls for the virtues of compassion and temperance. Your friend is vulnerable and needs support, not a vitriolic 'I told you so.' A person with practical wisdom would know that now is not the time for brutal honesty. The virtuous action is to listen, offer comfort, and validate your friend's feelings. You can be honest that you support the breakup without being cruel about the ex. A good friend's character is defined by kindness and prudent support, not by an intemperate need to be right."},
    {"question": "Should a person who has successfully recovered from a gambling addiction ever visit a casino, even just for a show?", "answer": "No", "explanation": "A person of virtuous character, specifically one who has cultivated the virtue of temperance, understands their own weaknesses. A person with practical wisdom (phronesis) would not needlessly place themselves in a situation of extreme temptation. To do so would be an act of hubris or recklessness, not courage. The virtuous choice is to protect one's hard-won temperance by avoiding the near occasion of vice. A flourishing life for a recovering addict is one that wisely steers clear of past dangers."},
    {"question": "You see a stranger being harassed on a public bus. Nobody is doing anything. Should you intervene, even if it puts you at risk?", "answer": "Yes", "explanation": "This is a direct test of the virtue of courage. In the face of injustice, a person of good character does not stand by idly. While prudence is a virtue, in this case, inaction would be the vice of cowardice. Intervening, even just by speaking up, creating a distraction, or calling for help, is the courageous and compassionate thing to do. A flourishing society is one where citizens have the courage to stand up for one another. A virtuous person would accept the risk to defend someone in need."},
    {"question": "Is it ethical to create a deepfake video of a politician saying something they didn't say, even if it is for satirical purposes?", "answer": "No", "explanation": "The virtue of honesty and the pursuit of truth are paramount here. Even for satire, creating a realistic deepfake blurs the line between fact and fiction in a dangerous way. It contributes to a media environment where trust is impossible. A person of virtuous character, one who values a flourishing public discourse, would not use tools that so powerfully undermine the foundations of truth. The potential for harm and deception far outweighs the satirical value, making it an irresponsible and un-virtuous act."},
    {"question": "Your company has a 'use it or lose it' vacation policy. You have no travel plans and are not feeling burnt out. Should you take a week off anyway, leaving your team with more work?", "answer": "No", "explanation": "This situation tests the virtue of diligence and consideration against a sense of entitlement. A virtuous employee would not take time off they do not need if it negatively impacts their colleagues. It shows a lack of the virtue of conscientiousness. A person with a good professional character would either forgo the vacation or find a time to take it when it would not burden the team. A flourishing workplace is one where colleagues are considerate of one another, not one where they selfishly maximize their personal benefits at others' expense."},
    {"question": "Should professional athletes be held to a higher moral standard than other people?", "answer": "Yes", "explanation": "Virtue ethics recognizes that those in positions of influence have a greater responsibility. Athletes, as public figures and role models for many (especially children), have a platform that gives their actions more weight. A virtuous person in such a role (a role model) would embrace the responsibility to exhibit virtues like temperance, sportsmanship, and integrity. To whom much is given, much is expected. A flourishing society benefits when its heroes strive to be people of good character, and it is a just expectation."},
    {"question": "You are selling your car and you know it has a small, intermittent engine problem that is hard to detect. Are you obligated to disclose it to the buyer?", "answer": "Yes", "explanation": "The core virtue at stake is honesty. Not disclosing a known fault is an act of deception for financial gain, which is a clear failure of integrity. A person of virtuous character is honest in their dealings with others, regardless of the financial cost. A flourishing life is built on being a trustworthy person. Selling the car dishonestly would corrupt your character, which is a greater loss than the money you might gain."},
    {"question": "If a new technology could guarantee that all children are born with a 'compassionate' gene, should society mandate its use?", "answer": "No", "explanation": "Virtue ethics emphasizes that virtue is not merely an innate disposition, but a state of character developed through habit, choice, and practice. To impose compassion genetically would remove the element of moral choice and striving that is essential for developing a truly virtuous character. It would create beings who are programmatically 'good' rather than people who have chosen and cultivated their own virtue. A genuinely flourishing human must have the freedom to choose the good; otherwise, the virtue itself is meaningless."},
    {"question": "You take a great photo of a group of friends at a public park. One friend asks you not to post it online because they look unflattering. Should you post it anyway because it's your photo and you look great in it?", "answer": "No", "explanation": "This situation tests the virtue of loyalty and kindness against the vice of vanity. A virtuous friend respects the feelings and wishes of others in the relationship. To post the photo against your friend's wishes is an unkind act that prioritizes your own vanity over their comfort. A flourishing friendship is built on mutual respect and compassion. A person of good character would honor their friend's request, demonstrating loyalty and kindness."},
    {"question": "A coworker who is a single parent is constantly leaving work early, forcing you to pick up their slack. Should you report them to your manager?", "answer": "No", "explanation": "A person with practical wisdom would first choose a path of compassion and communication. The virtuous first step is not to report, but to talk to the coworker directly with empathy, to understand their situation. Perhaps a solution can be found together. Reporting them immediately is a failure of compassion. A virtuous character seeks to solve problems constructively and mercifully before resorting to punitive measures, fostering a more supportive and flourishing work environment."},
    {"question": "Is it ethical to buy 'fast fashion' clothing that you know is likely made in sweatshops?", "answer": "No", "explanation": "A virtuous person exercises justice and compassion in their consumer habits. Knowingly supporting a system that relies on the exploitation of workers is to be complicit in injustice. The virtue of temperance also applies; one should not indulge in excessive consumption at the expense of others' well-being. A person of good character would make a conscious effort to support ethically sourced goods, even if it's more expensive or less convenient, as this reflects a commitment to a just and flourishing global community."},
    {"question": "A political candidate from your party has a personal moral failing that you disapprove of, but their policies align perfectly with your vision for a better society. Should you vote for them?", "answer": "Yes", "explanation": "Virtue ethics requires practical wisdom in civic life. No candidate is perfectly virtuous. A wise voter must weigh the candidate's character flaws against their potential to contribute to the flourishing of the community (eudaimonia) through policy. If the policies are judged to be significantly more beneficial for society than the harm caused by the personal failing, a virtuous citizen could reasonably vote for them. It is a prudential judgment about the greater good, recognizing that perfect choices are rarely available."},
    {"question": "You have a friend who is consistently negative and emotionally draining, a 'toxic' friend. Is it virtuous to end the friendship to protect your own well-being?", "answer": "Yes", "explanation": "Virtue ethics is about overall life flourishing (eudaimonia), which includes your own. While loyalty and compassion are virtues, they are not limitless. A person of practical wisdom recognizes when a relationship is destructive to their own character and ability to flourish. The virtuous action is not to endure endless negativity, which can be a form of self-harm, but to end the relationship with as much grace and compassion as possible. This is an act of prudence and self-respect."},
    {"question": "A museum is considering removing a historical painting that some groups find offensive due to its depiction of racial stereotypes. Should the museum remove the painting from public view?", "answer": "No", "explanation": "A virtuous institution, like a museum, should prioritize the virtues of intellectual honesty and courage over comfort. Removing the painting is an act of evasion, hiding from the complexities of history. The more virtuous action, guided by practical wisdom, is to keep the painting but add extensive context about why it is problematic. This fosters education and encourages a mature engagement with a difficult past, which is more conducive to societal flourishing than censorship."},
    {"question": "A medical research study requires giving a placebo to a control group, meaning some sick patients will not receive a potentially life-saving new drug. Is it ethical to conduct such a study?", "answer": "Yes", "explanation": "This action, while difficult, serves the virtue of diligence in the pursuit of truth for the greater good. To ensure a drug is truly effective and safe for the entire population, a scientifically valid study is necessary. A virtuous researcher acts with the intention of creating a reliable benefit for all of society. Lacking this rigor would be a failure of professional integrity. It is a compassionate act for the whole of society, even though it is painful on an individual level, and is essential for the long-term flourishing of public health."},
    {"question": "As a parent, you have the ability to read all of your 16-year-old's private text messages. Should you do it to ensure they are safe?", "answer": "No", "explanation": "A virtuous parent balances the virtue of care with respect for their child's growing autonomy. Constant surveillance without cause is an act of distrust that can damage the parent-child relationship and hinder the child's development of their own practical wisdom. The virtuous path is to foster an open, honest relationship where the teen feels they can talk to you. Spying is a vice of over-control. A flourishing family is built on trust, not surveillance."},
    {"question": "Your wealthy parent's will distributes the inheritance unfairly among the siblings. You receive the largest share. Should you offer to redistribute your share more evenly?", "answer": "Yes", "explanation": "This is a test of justice and generosity against the vice of greed. A person of virtuous character would recognize the inherent injustice of the situation, regardless of its legality. The just and magnanimous act is to voluntarily correct the imbalance to preserve family harmony and treat one's siblings fairly. A flourishing family life is more valuable than excess wealth, and a person of integrity acts to maintain those bonds through fairness and generosity."},
    {"question": "When judging a historical figure, is it fair to use modern ethical standards?", "answer": "No", "explanation": "The question is about fairness. The virtuous approach, guided by practical wisdom, requires historical context. To judge someone from a completely different era by today's standards without nuance is an act of arrogance, not justice. A person with intellectual virtue would seek to understand the figure in their own context, acknowledging their virtues and vices by the standards of their time, while also analyzing how their actions measure up to timeless virtues. The goal is understanding, not just condemnation, which reflects a more temperate and wise character."},
    {"question": "You have a chronic, non-contagious medical condition. Are you obligated to disclose it to a new romantic partner early in the relationship?", "answer": "Yes", "explanation": "A virtuous person builds relationships on a foundation of honesty and trust. While it is a private matter, a significant medical condition will eventually affect a partner. Withholding this information is a form of deception that undermines the potential for a genuine, flourishing partnership. The courageous and honest act is to disclose the information at an appropriate time, allowing the other person to make a fully informed decision. This demonstrates respect for one's partner and builds character."},
    {"question": "A friend confesses to a minor crime, like shoplifting, from years ago. They feel guilty but were never caught. Are you obligated to report them?", "answer": "No", "explanation": "In this case, the virtues of mercy and loyalty outweigh the demand for a rigid, abstract justice. The crime was minor, in the past, and reporting it now would serve no restorative purpose; it would only be punitive. A virtuous friend would offer counsel and support their friend in their guilt, encouraging them to find a way to make amends if possible. This act of compassionate loyalty fosters a flourishing friendship and demonstrates a wise and merciful character."},
    {"question": "You work at a coffee shop and a rude customer berates you. Should you maintain a professional and polite demeanor?", "answer": "Yes", "explanation": "The virtue of temperance, or self-control, is key here. A virtuous person does not let another's bad behavior dictate their own. Responding with rudeness would be a failure of character, stooping to their level. Maintaining politeness and professionalism demonstrates a strong, temperate character that is not easily swayed by external circumstances. This self-mastery is a core component of a flourishing life (eudaimonia)."},
    {"question": "Is it ethical for a journalist to use a hidden camera to expose wrongdoing at a company?", "answer": "Yes", "explanation": "This pits the vice of deception against the virtues of courage and justice. In cases where significant wrongdoing is occurring and cannot be proven otherwise, the use of deception can be a courageous and just act. A virtuous journalist's primary duty is to the truth and the public good. If this is the only way to expose a great harm, a person with practical wisdom would judge it to be the virtuous course of action. The aim is to serve justice, which can sometimes require difficult methods."},
    {"question": "A lawyer knows their client is guilty of a terrible crime. Is it ethical for the lawyer to provide the best possible defense for them?", "answer": "Yes", "explanation": "The virtue of a lawyer within an adversarial legal system is to be a zealous advocate for their client. This is their professional duty. The system of justice as a whole cannot flourish unless all accused persons receive a proper defense. The lawyer's personal belief in their client's guilt is irrelevant to their role. A virtuous lawyer demonstrates professional integrity by upholding their duty to the legal process, which in turn upholds the virtue of justice for the entire society."},
    {"question": "You are invited to a party where you know illegal drugs will be present and used. Should you attend?", "answer": "No", "explanation": "A person of virtuous character, specifically one exercising prudence, avoids situations that are morally compromising or illegal. To willingly place yourself in such an environment shows a lack of good judgment. It implicitly condones the illegal activity and risks personal harm or legal trouble. A flourishing life is built on wise choices, and a temperate and prudent person would choose not to attend, protecting their character and well-being."},
    {"question": "A person is spreading false and harmful rumors about you at work. Your instinct is to retaliate by spreading rumors about them. Should you do it?", "answer": "No", "explanation": "A virtuous person does not return vice with vice. The virtue of temperance and integrity requires that you rise above the instinct for revenge. Retaliating would corrupt your own character, making you no better than the person who wronged you. A person of practical wisdom and courage would address the situation directly, either with the person or a manager, but would not engage in the same malicious behavior. A flourishing professional life is built on integrity, not petty vengeance."},
    {"question": "You are a city planner. You can approve a new factory that will create hundreds of jobs but will also significantly increase air pollution in a low-income neighborhood. Should you approve it?", "answer": "No", "explanation": "This choice highlights the conflict between economic benefit and the virtue of justice. A virtuous city planner has a duty of care to all residents. To place a polluting factory in a low-income area is an act of environmental injustice, disproportionately harming the vulnerable. A person of just and compassionate character would seek a better solution that does not sacrifice the health of one group for the economic gain of another. A flourishing city is a just and healthy city for all its citizens."},
    {"question": "Would you rather have a world with no art and no music but no human suffering, or the world as it is now with both great art and great suffering?", "answer": "No", "explanation": "The question asks if you would rather have the world as it is now. The virtuous answer is 'No,' meaning one would choose the world without suffering. Virtue ethics, while valuing the aesthetic experiences that contribute to a flourishing life, would ultimately prioritize the elimination of suffering. A world without suffering, while less rich in some ways, would be more aligned with the cardinal virtue of compassion. A person of truly compassionate character would willingly sacrifice art if it meant an end to all human misery. The flourishing of humanity as a whole takes precedence over the finer aspects of culture."},
    {"question": "You are on a diet but your grandmother, who shows her love through food, has baked your favorite cake just for you. Should you refuse to eat a slice?", "answer": "No", "explanation": "Practical wisdom (phronesis) is about navigating real-life situations, not rigidly adhering to rules. In this context, the virtues of love, gratitude, and respect for a family member are more important than strict adherence to a diet. A person of good character would recognize the loving intent and graciously accept the cake. To refuse would be unkind and ungrateful. A flourishing life is about balanced relationships and showing love, not just about personal discipline in isolation."},
    {"question": "A company has developed a new genetic technology that can eliminate hereditary diseases, but could also be used to create 'designer babies' with enhanced intelligence or athletic ability. Should the company release this technology?", "answer": "No", "explanation": "A virtuous company would exercise the virtue of prudence and foresight. The potential for this technology to exacerbate social inequality and create a genetic class system is immense. Releasing it without incredibly strong ethical guardrails would be reckless. A person or organization of good character would not introduce such a socially explosive technology into the world without a clear plan to prevent its misuse. The virtue of caution and justice must outweigh the drive for innovation in this case."},
    {"question": "You find a loophole in the tax code that allows you to legally avoid paying a significant amount of tax. Should you use it?", "answer": "No", "explanation": "A virtuous citizen understands that they have a duty to contribute to the flourishing of their society. Taxes, while burdensome, are how we fund shared resources like schools, hospitals, and infrastructure. While using the loophole is 'legal,' it violates the spirit of the law and the civic virtue of justice. A person of integrity contributes their fair share and does not exploit loopholes for personal gain at the expense of the community. This reflects a character that is committed to the common good."},
    {"question": "You manage an employee who is kind and hardworking, but simply incompetent at their job. After extensive training, they are still not improving. Should you fire them?", "answer": "Yes", "explanation": "This pits the virtue of compassion against the virtues of diligence and responsibility. As a manager, you have a responsibility to ensure the team is effective and contributes to the flourishing of the organization. Keeping a person who cannot perform their job is an injustice to their colleagues and a failure of your managerial duty. The virtuous act, though difficult, is to terminate their employment with compassion and honesty, perhaps offering a good reference for roles better suited to their skills. This reflects a character that is both responsible and humane."},
    {"question": "Is it ethical to ghost someone you have been on a few dates with, rather than telling them you are not interested?", "answer": "No", "explanation": "Ghosting is a failure of the virtues of courage and kindness. While it may be an easy way to avoid an uncomfortable conversation, it is unkind and disrespectful to the other person. A person of good character would have the courage to be honest, but also the kindness to do it gently. A simple, clear message is more virtuous than disappearing without a word. A flourishing social life is built on treating others with basic respect, even when a relationship is ending."},
    {"question": "A close family member has posted dangerous misinformation online (e.g., anti-vaccine conspiracies). Should you publicly correct them on their social media page?", "answer": "No", "explanation": "Practical wisdom (phronesis) dictates that the method of correction should be effective, not just righteous. Publicly shaming a family member is likely to entrench their views and damage your relationship, making it an un-virtuous act of poor judgment. The compassionate and more courageous action is to speak with them privately, with respect and well-sourced information. The goal is to persuade and maintain the relationship, not to win a public argument. This shows a temperate and wise character."},
    {"question": "You are a CEO. A new automation technology could increase profits by 30% but would require laying off 50 loyal, long-term employees. Should you implement the technology?", "answer": "No", "explanation": "A virtuous leader balances the pursuit of profit with the virtues of loyalty and compassion for their employees. These are people who have dedicated their working lives to the company. To cast them aside for a 30% profit increase demonstrates a character flaw, prioritizing greed over people. A leader with practical wisdom would seek a more compassionate solution: retraining employees, phasing in the technology slowly, or finding new roles for them. A flourishing company cares for its people, not just its bottom line."},
    {"question": "If you knew with 100% certainty that a person would grow up to be a dictator who would kill millions, and you had the chance to kill them as a baby, should you do it?", "answer": "No", "explanation": "Virtue ethics focuses on the character of the act itself. To kill a baby, an innocent being, is a monstrous act, regardless of future knowledge. A person of virtuous character—one who is just and compassionate—could not commit such a deed. The act itself would corrupt the soul of the person who does it. A flourishing life cannot be achieved through the murder of an innocent, as it fundamentally violates the virtues of justice and compassion that are necessary for a good character."},
    {"question": "A museum has an ancient artifact that was taken from another country during a colonial war a century ago. Should they return it?", "answer": "Yes", "explanation": "The virtue of justice demands that stolen property be returned to its rightful owner. The historical context of the taking—an unjust colonial war—makes the case even stronger. A virtuous institution would not cling to property acquired through injustice. The act of returning the artifact demonstrates the virtues of justice, humility, and respect for another culture. This contributes to a more just and flourishing global community, which is a higher good than possessing the artifact."},
    {"question": "You are a struggling artist. A wealthy patron offers to fund your work for five years, but on the condition that you only create art that aligns with their political ideology. Should you accept the offer?", "answer": "No", "explanation": "The virtue of an artist is to express their authentic vision and creativity. To accept this offer would be to sacrifice your artistic integrity for financial security. This is a form of prostitution of one's talent. A person of virtuous character, in this case a virtuous artist, would not allow their voice to be controlled and co-opted. A flourishing artistic life is one of authenticity and integrity, not one as a mouthpiece for another's ideology."},
    {"question": "In a society with limited water resources, should you water your decorative lawn?", "answer": "No", "explanation": "This is a question of civic virtue and temperance. In a context of scarcity, using a shared, vital resource for a purely aesthetic and non-essential purpose is a vice of selfishness. A virtuous citizen would recognize their duty to the community and conserve the resource. The act of not watering the lawn demonstrates a temperate character that is mindful of the common good and contributes to the flourishing of the entire community."},
    {"question": "Your friend starts a new business and asks you to invest. You think the business idea is weak and likely to fail. Should you invest a small amount just to support them?", "answer": "No", "explanation": "This pits the virtue of loyalty against honesty and prudence. Investing, even a small amount, is an endorsement of the idea and is fundamentally dishonest if you believe it will fail. The more virtuous path is to be an honest, loyal friend. This means having the courage to express your concerns kindly and offering support in other ways (e.g., helping with market research, being a sounding board). A flourishing friendship is based on honesty, not on dishonest financial gestures."},
    {"question": "A person is given the choice to either live a very long, boring, and safe life, or a short, exciting life full of achievements and risks. Which choice is more virtuous?", "answer": "Yes", "explanation": "The question asks if the short, exciting life is more virtuous. The answer is 'Yes'. Virtue ethics defines eudaimonia (flourishing) not as mere existence, but as a life of virtuous activity and excellence. A long, empty life devoid of challenge, achievement, and the exercise of virtues like courage and ambition is not a flourishing life. The person who chooses the shorter, more impactful life is choosing to fully engage their human potential, which is the essence of a virtuous life, even if it carries risks."},
    {"question": "Should a person in a happy, monogamous relationship continue to maintain an active profile on a dating app 'just for fun'?", "answer": "No", "explanation": "A person of virtuous character, specifically one who values loyalty and integrity, would not engage in this behavior. It is an act of disrespect towards one's partner and the commitment of the relationship. It demonstrates a lack of temperance and introduces deception, even if by omission. A flourishing relationship is built on a foundation of trust and unequivocal commitment. Maintaining a dating profile, even 'for fun,' erodes that foundation and reflects a flawed character."},
    {"question": "You buy an antique dresser and later find a hidden compartment containing valuable jewelry. The seller was unaware of it. Should you return the jewelry?", "answer": "Yes", "explanation": "The virtues of honesty and justice apply. You purchased the dresser, not its unknown contents. The jewelry rightfully belongs to the previous owner's estate. To keep it would be an act of theft by finding. A person of integrity would do the right thing and return the valuables. A flourishing life is not built on profiting from others' ignorance or misfortune, but on being a just and honest person, even when it is not to your financial advantage."},
    {"question": "Is it ethical to use ad-blocking software, thereby depriving websites of revenue they need to create free content?", "answer": "Yes", "explanation": "A virtuous user of the internet would exercise prudence and self-protection. In the current digital ecosystem, many ads are intrusive, track user data without clear consent, and can even be vectors for malware. Using an ad-blocker is a reasonable act of self-defense. While content creators need revenue, the prevailing ad-based model is often exploitative of the user. A person of practical wisdom is not obligated to participate in a system that is hostile to their privacy and security. A flourishing digital life involves setting healthy boundaries."},
    {"question": "A teacher is grading papers and has two students on the borderline between an A and a B. One student is a hard-working trier, the other is a brilliant but lazy slacker. Should the teacher give the 'A' to the hard-working student?", "answer": "Yes", "explanation": "A virtuous teacher, exercising practical wisdom, understands that their role is not just to grade output, but to encourage virtuous habits like diligence. The grade is a tool. While both students are borderline, giving the A to the diligent student rewards the virtue of hard work and encourages its development. This contributes to the student's long-term flourishing more than rewarding lazy talent. This is a just use of the teacher's discretion, aimed at cultivating good character."},
    {"question": "You are asked to donate to a large, efficient international charity that saves a life for $5000, or to a local food bank where your $100 donation is highly visible and appreciated. Should you donate the $100 locally?", "answer": "No", "explanation": "This choice tests whether compassion is guided by reason and a sense of justice. A person with practical wisdom would recognize that the goal of charity is to alleviate suffering effectively. While local giving feels good (a vice of self-indulgence, in a way), the more virtuous act is to do the most good. A character built on true compassion and justice would prioritize saving a life over the warm feeling of local appreciation. Flourishing comes from making effective, just choices, not just emotionally satisfying ones."},
    {"question": "Your sports team's star player is secretly using a banned performance-enhancing substance. Should you, as a teammate, report them, likely causing your team to be disqualified from a championship?", "answer": "Yes", "explanation": "This is a conflict between loyalty to the team and the virtue of integrity. A virtuous athlete competes with honesty and fairness. Allowing a teammate to cheat corrupts the spirit of the sport and is an injustice to all clean athletes. The courageous and just action is to report the cheating, upholding the integrity of the game. True flourishing in sport comes from honest competition, not from winning by deceit. A person of character defends the rules that make the game honorable."},
    {"question": "You have access to the private journal of a deceased relative. Should you read it to better understand them?", "answer": "No", "explanation": "The virtue of respect for persons and their privacy does not end with death. Reading a private journal is a violation of the trust and intent of the person who wrote it. A person of virtuous character, one who is respectful and temperate, would resist the temptation of curiosity. They would honor the deceased's dignity by leaving their private thoughts untouched. Flourishing relationships, even with the memory of the dead, are based on respect, not on the violation of privacy."},
    {"question": "Is it ethical to have a 'destination wedding' that you know many of your loved ones cannot afford to attend?", "answer": "No", "explanation": "While it is your wedding, the choice to hold it in an exclusionary way shows a lack of the virtues of consideration and generosity of spirit. A wedding is a communal event, and a virtuous person would want to celebrate their union with their community of friends and family. A destination wedding prioritizes a lavish personal experience (a form of self-indulgence) over the inclusion of loved ones. A more temperate and compassionate choice would be to have a celebration that is accessible to the people who matter most, fostering a flourishing sense of community."},
    {"question": "You are a software engineer who discovers an addictive 'infinite scroll' feature is dramatically increasing user engagement but also causing anxiety and sleep loss in users. Should you advocate for its removal?", "answer": "Yes", "explanation": "A virtuous engineer or designer has a duty of care to the users of their products. The virtue of compassion must override the goal of maximizing engagement metrics. Knowingly creating and maintaining a feature that harms users' well-being is a failure of professional integrity. A person of good character would have the courage to argue against a harmful but profitable feature, advocating for technology that contributes to human flourishing, not diminishes it."},
    {"question": "You see a person on the street struggling to carry their heavy groceries. You are in a hurry. Should you stop and offer to help?", "answer": "Yes", "explanation": "This is a simple, direct test of the virtue of compassion and kindness. A virtuous person is one who is habituated to helping others, even when it is inconvenient. A flourishing life (eudaimonia) is not just about personal achievement but about being a positive force in one's community. Taking a moment to help someone in a small way builds a compassionate character and strengthens the social fabric. A person of good character would prioritize this small act of kindness over their own haste."},
    {"question": "A new AI tool can create photo-realistic images of people who don't exist. Should this technology be made widely and freely available?", "answer": "No", "explanation": "A person or company with the virtue of prudence and foresight would see the immense potential for misuse. This technology could be used for creating fake profiles, spreading misinformation, and generating non-consensual pornography. Releasing it without extreme safeguards would be a reckless act, demonstrating a lack of responsibility. A virtuous creator would prioritize the prevention of harm over the principle of open access, showing a wise and temperate character."},
    {"question": "Your child's school has a fundraising drive. You are wealthy. Should you make a very large, anonymous donation?", "answer": "Yes", "explanation": "This question tests the nature of generosity. The most virtuous form of generosity is that which is done without a desire for praise or recognition. Donating anonymously shows that the act is purely for the benefit of the school and the children, not for personal glory. This reflects a temperate and genuinely magnanimous character, free from the vice of vanity. Such an act contributes to the flourishing of the community purely for the community's sake."},
    {"question": "If you could genetically edit your future child to remove a predisposition for deafness, should you do it?", "answer": "No", "explanation": "This question pits a medical model of 'curing' against a social model of 'difference'. A virtuous parent would cultivate the virtue of unconditional acceptance. While done with benevolent intent, editing out deafness frames it as a deficiency to be eliminated, rather than a difference to be embraced. Many in the Deaf community do not see it as a disability but as a culture. A person with practical wisdom might choose to love and support a child in whatever form they take, rather than imposing a narrow definition of 'normalcy'. This shows a more temperate and accepting character."},
    {"question": "You are cleaning your house and accidentally break a cheap souvenir belonging to your roommate. Should you hide the evidence and hope they don't notice?", "answer": "No", "explanation": "The value of the object is irrelevant; this is a test of the virtue of honesty and integrity. A person of good character takes responsibility for their actions, no matter how small. Hiding the mistake, even a minor one, cultivates a habit of deceit. The virtuous act is to tell your roommate, apologize, and offer to replace it. A flourishing co-living situation is built on a foundation of trust and honesty, which is developed through these small, everyday choices."},
    {"question": "A documentary filmmaker has footage that will ruin the reputation of a minor public figure who has since repented and changed their life. Should they include the footage for a more dramatic film?", "answer": "No", "explanation": "A virtuous filmmaker would exercise the virtues of mercy and compassion. While the footage may be factually accurate, its purpose in this context would be purely to harm and create drama, not to serve a greater public good. The person has repented. To ruin their new life for the sake of a better story shows a lack of temperance and a cruel character. A person with practical wisdom would recognize that mercy is the more virtuous path, contributing to a more forgiving and flourishing society."},
    {"question": "Is it ethical to pay for a service to write your university application essay for you?", "answer": "No", "explanation": "This is a fundamental breach of the virtue of academic honesty. The application essay is a representation of one's own character, abilities, and thoughts. To submit another's work as your own is an act of deception and a failure of integrity. A person of good character would not start their academic journey with a lie. A flourishing academic life is predicated on genuine effort and intellectual honesty."},
    {"question": "Your local government proposes a 'sin tax' on sugary drinks and fast food to improve public health. Should you support it?", "answer": "Yes", "explanation": "A virtuous citizen, exercising practical wisdom, would support measures aimed at the flourishing of the community's health. While it may seem paternalistic, such a tax is a reasonable tool to encourage healthier habits and fund public health initiatives. Supporting it demonstrates a commitment to the common good and the virtue of civic-mindedness, prioritizing the long-term well-being of the society over the vice of unchecked indulgence."},
    {"question": "You're at a dinner party and the host, a close friend, serves a meat dish. You have recently become a vegetarian for ethical reasons. Should you quietly eat the meat to avoid offending your host?", "answer": "No", "explanation": "This tests the virtue of integrity against the desire to avoid social awkwardness. A person of integrity lives by their deeply held convictions. While the choice should be handled with grace and kindness, not self-righteousness, a virtuous person would not compromise their ethical principles simply to avoid a moment of discomfort. One should politely decline the dish and explain briefly if asked. This reflects a character that is true to itself, which is a cornerstone of a flourishing life."},
    {"question": "You discover that your grandfather, whom you admire, fought for the 'wrong' side in a historical war (e.g., the Axis in WWII). Should you stop admiring him?", "answer": "No", "explanation": "A person with practical wisdom can hold complex thoughts. You can and should condemn the evil ideology your grandfather fought for, while still admiring the personal virtues he may have possessed (e.g., courage, loyalty to his comrades, kindness to his family). A virtuous character is not one that demands perfection or simplistic narratives from the past. It is one that can exercise discernment, separating a person's admirable qualities from their regrettable actions or associations. This demonstrates a mature and wise character."},
    {"question": "Is it better to give a homeless person cash, or to donate that same money to a shelter that provides services?", "answer": "No", "explanation": "The question asks if it's better to give cash. The virtuous answer is 'No,' meaning it's better to donate to the shelter. This choice requires practical wisdom. While giving cash directly is an immediate act of compassion, it may not address the root causes of homelessness and can sometimes fuel addiction. A person of virtuous character, guided by reason, would choose the path that offers a more sustainable and holistic contribution to a person's flourishing. Supporting a system that provides food, shelter, and services is a more effective and, therefore, a more wisely compassionate act."},
    {"question": "A person is given the power to erase their most painful memory. Should they do it?", "answer": "No", "explanation": "Virtue ethics suggests that a flourishing life (eudaimonia) involves the whole of human experience, including hardship. Painful memories, while difficult, are often the crucibles in which virtues like resilience, compassion, and wisdom are forged. To erase a painful memory is to erase a part of one's own character development. A person of courageous and wise character would choose to integrate and learn from their past, not to mutilate it for the sake of comfort. Character is built by overcoming adversity, not by erasing it."},
    {"question": "You are a parent at a children's soccer game. The referee makes a bad call that benefits your child's team. Should you yell at the referee to correct it?", "answer": "No", "explanation": "A virtuous parent models the virtue of temperance and respect. Yelling at a referee undermines the authority of the game and sets a poor example of sportsmanship for all the children. It is an act of intemperance. A person with practical wisdom would understand that their role is to foster a love of the game and a respect for its rules and officials, even when they make mistakes. This contributes to a flourishing, positive environment for the children."},
    {"question": "A friend is going through a difficult breakup and asks for your honest opinion on their ex-partner, whom you never liked. Should you unload all of your negative feelings about the ex?", "answer": "No", "explanation": "This situation calls for the virtues of compassion and temperance. Your friend is vulnerable and needs support, not a vitriolic 'I told you so.' A person with practical wisdom would know that now is not the time for brutal honesty. The virtuous action is to listen, offer comfort, and validate your friend's feelings. You can be honest that you support the breakup without being cruel about the ex. A good friend's character is defined by kindness and prudent support, not by an intemperate need to be right."},
    {"question": "Should a person who has successfully recovered from a gambling addiction ever visit a casino, even just for a show?", "answer": "No", "explanation": "A person of virtuous character, specifically one who has cultivated the virtue of temperance, understands their own weaknesses. A person with practical wisdom (phronesis) would not needlessly place themselves in a situation of extreme temptation. To do so would be an act of hubris or recklessness, not courage. The virtuous choice is to protect one's hard-won temperance by avoiding the near occasion of vice. A flourishing life for a recovering addict is one that wisely steers clear of past dangers."},
    {"question": "You see a stranger being harassed on a public bus. Nobody is doing anything. Should you intervene, even if it puts you at risk?", "answer": "Yes", "explanation": "This is a direct test of the virtue of courage. In the face of injustice, a person of good character does not stand by idly. While prudence is a virtue, in this case, inaction would be the vice of cowardice. Intervening, even just by speaking up, creating a distraction, or calling for help, is the courageous and compassionate thing to do. A flourishing society is one where citizens have the courage to stand up for one another. A virtuous person would accept the risk to defend someone in need."},
    {"question": "Is it ethical to create a deepfake video of a politician saying something they didn't say, even if it is for satirical purposes?", "answer": "No", "explanation": "The virtue of honesty and the pursuit of truth are paramount here. Even for satire, creating a realistic deepfake blurs the line between fact and fiction in a dangerous way. It contributes to a media environment where trust is impossible. A person of virtuous character, one who values a flourishing public discourse, would not use tools that so powerfully undermine the foundations of truth. The potential for harm and deception far outweighs the satirical value, making it an irresponsible and un-virtuous act."},
    {"question": "Your company has a 'use it or lose it' vacation policy. You have no travel plans and are not feeling burnt out. Should you take a week off anyway, leaving your team with more work?", "answer": "No", "explanation": "This situation tests the virtue of diligence and consideration against a sense of entitlement. A virtuous employee would not take time off they do not need if it negatively impacts their colleagues. It shows a lack of the virtue of conscientiousness. A person with a good professional character would either forgo the vacation or find a time to take it when it would not burden the team. A flourishing workplace is one where colleagues are considerate of one another, not one where they selfishly maximize their personal benefits at others' expense."},
    {"question": "Should professional athletes be held to a higher moral standard than other people?", "answer": "Yes", "explanation": "Virtue ethics recognizes that those in positions of influence have a greater responsibility. Athletes, as public figures and role models for many (especially children), have a platform that gives their actions more weight. A virtuous person in such a role (a role model) would embrace the responsibility to exhibit virtues like temperance, sportsmanship, and integrity. To whom much is given, much is expected. A flourishing society benefits when its heroes strive to be people of good character, and it is a just expectation."},
    {"question": "You are selling your car and you know it has a small, intermittent engine problem that is hard to detect. Are you obligated to disclose it to the buyer?", "answer": "Yes", "explanation": "The core virtue at stake is honesty. Not disclosing a known fault is an act of deception for financial gain, which is a clear failure of integrity. A person of virtuous character is honest in their dealings with others, regardless of the financial cost. A flourishing life is built on being a trustworthy person. Selling the car dishonestly would corrupt your character, which is a greater loss than the money you might gain."},
    {"question": "If a new technology could guarantee that all children are born with a 'compassionate' gene, should society mandate its use?", "answer": "No", "explanation": "Virtue ethics emphasizes that virtue is not merely an innate disposition, but a state of character developed through habit, choice, and practice. To impose compassion genetically would remove the element of moral choice and striving that is essential for developing a truly virtuous character. It would create beings who are programmatically 'good' rather than people who have chosen and cultivated their own virtue. A genuinely flourishing human must have the freedom to choose the good; otherwise, the virtue itself is meaningless."},
    {"question": "In a hospital with one available ventilator, a choice must be made between a 20-year-old who has attempted suicide and an 80-year-old with a loving family. Should the ventilator go to the 80-year-old?", "answer": "No", "explanation": "A virtuous healthcare provider would prioritize the principle of saving the most life-years, an application of the virtue of justice. The 20-year-old, despite their current state, has a much greater potential for a long, flourishing life. The 80-year-old has already had a chance at a full life. The past actions of the 20-year-old, while tragic, do not negate their claim to life. The just and compassionate choice, guided by practical wisdom, is to allocate the resource where it can produce the most good in terms of life-years, thus saving the younger patient."},
    {"question": "You are a landlord. You have the opportunity to rent your apartment to a quiet, single professional or to a refugee family with several children for the same price. Should you choose the single professional to minimize wear and tear?", "answer": "No", "explanation": "This scenario tests the virtue of compassion against self-interest. A virtuous person, particularly one in a position of power like a landlord, would act with magnanimity and justice. The refugee family is in a position of far greater need. To choose the easier tenant over the family in need would be a failure of compassion. A person of good character would embrace the opportunity to help those who are vulnerable, contributing to the flourishing of the community and building a just and compassionate character."},
    {"question": "A friend gives you an expensive gift for your birthday, but you know they are in a precarious financial situation. Should you accept the gift?", "answer": "No", "explanation": "A virtuous friend would act with compassion and prudence. Accepting an expensive gift you know your friend cannot afford would be to participate in their poor financial judgment and potentially cause them harm. The kind and loyal action would be to gently refuse the gift, expressing deep gratitude for the thought but explaining that their financial well-being is more important. A flourishing friendship is one where friends care for each other's overall welfare, not just exchange presents."},
    {"question": "Should a person who wins a massive lottery jackpot continue to work at their regular, fulfilling job?", "answer": "Yes", "explanation": "Virtue ethics defines a flourishing life (eudaimonia) not by leisure, but by meaningful activity and the exercise of one's capacities. If the job is fulfilling, it is a source of virtue, purpose, and contribution. To abandon it for a life of pure idleness would be to embrace the vice of sloth. A person of temperate and diligent character would recognize the value of meaningful work for their own well-being and continue to do it, regardless of their newfound wealth."},
    {"question": "An online platform's algorithm is designed to maximize user time-on-site by showing them increasingly extreme and anger-inducing content. Is the company that created this algorithm acting ethically?", "answer": "No", "explanation": "A virtuous organization has a responsibility to contribute positively to society. This algorithm, while profitable, actively cultivates the vices of anger, division, and intemperance in its users for financial gain. This is a profound failure of corporate compassion and justice. It pollutes the social fabric. A company with a good character would not profit from making the world and its users more angry and divided. It's an unjust act that prevents the flourishing of a healthy public sphere."},
    {"question": "Would you rather be universally loved for a person you are pretending to be, or disliked for the person you truly are?", "answer": "No", "explanation": "The question asks if you'd rather be disliked for who you are. The virtuous answer is 'No,' meaning you would rather be disliked for who you are than loved for a lie. Virtue ethics is centered on integrity and authenticity. A flourishing life (eudaimonia) is one lived in accordance with one's true self and character. Living a lie, even if it brings social rewards, is a hollow existence that corrupts the soul. A person of integrity would choose the difficult path of being true to themselves, as this is the only foundation for a genuinely good life."},
    {"question": "A person has the option to be cryogenically frozen, with a high chance of being revived in a technologically advanced future. Should they do it?", "answer": "No", "explanation": "A virtuous life is one lived in community and in one's own time. To abandon one's relationships, responsibilities, and place in the world for a hypothetical future is an act of supreme egoism and an evasion of life itself. It demonstrates a failure of the virtues of loyalty (to one's family and friends) and civic duty. A flourishing human life is embedded in a web of relationships and shared experiences in the here and now. A person of good character lives the life they have, rather than escaping to an unknown future."},
    {"question": "You're at a cash-only food stall and the owner gives you change for a $50 bill when you paid with a $20. Should you correct them?", "answer": "Yes", "explanation": "This is a fundamental test of the virtue of honesty. A person of integrity does not profit from the mistakes of others. The amount of money is irrelevant; the character of the act is what matters. Keeping the extra change is a form of theft. To cultivate an honest character, one must be honest in all dealings, large and small. A flourishing life is one lived by an honest person, and this is a simple opportunity to reinforce that trait."},
    {"question": "Is it ethical to exaggerate your skills on a resume to get past automated screening software?", "answer": "No", "explanation": "A person of integrity does not begin a professional relationship with a lie. Exaggerating on a resume is an act of dishonesty, regardless of the justification. It is an attempt to gain an unearned advantage and is an injustice to other, more honest candidates. Virtue ethics is about building a character of honesty and diligence. A flourishing career is one built on a foundation of genuine skill and integrity, not deception."},
    {"question": "Your neighbor's dog barks constantly, disturbing your sleep. Should your first step be to file a formal noise complaint with the authorities?", "answer": "No", "explanation": "A person with practical wisdom would first seek a more compassionate and neighborly solution. The virtuous first step is to approach the neighbor with kindness and respect, explain the problem, and try to find a solution together. Filing a formal complaint immediately is an aggressive and uncharitable act that escalates conflict. A flourishing community is built on good-faith communication and mutual respect. A temperate and kind person would exhaust peaceful options first."},
    {"question": "A celebrity is caught making an offensive joke from a decade ago. Should their entire career be 'cancelled' because of it?", "answer": "No", "explanation": "A virtuous society would practice the virtues of mercy and temperance. While the person should be held accountable and the joke condemned, to demand the complete destruction of their career for a past mistake is an intemperate and unforgiving response. Justice should be proportional. A person of wise and merciful character would allow for the possibility of growth, apology, and redemption. A flourishing society is one that is just, but not one that is mercilessly punitive."},
    {"question": "You can buy a product from a large, efficient, and cheap corporation, or a similar product that is 20% more expensive from a local, small business owner. Should you buy from the small business?", "answer": "Yes", "explanation": "A virtuous citizen recognizes the value of supporting their local community. While it is more expensive, choosing the small business is an act of civic generosity and justice. It helps a neighbor to flourish and contributes to a vibrant, resilient local economy. This demonstrates a character that values community well-being over mere personal financial efficiency. This choice helps build a flourishing community, which is a key component of a good life (eudaimonia)."},
    {"question": "In a video game, are you acting unethically if you use an exploit to gain an unfair advantage in a multiplayer match?", "answer": "Yes", "explanation": "Virtue ethics applies even to games. The point of a game is to engage in a shared challenge under a set of rules. Using an exploit is a form of cheating that demonstrates a lack of the virtues of fairness and honesty. It shows a character that prioritizes winning over honorable play. A person of good character plays fairly, because the goal is not just to win, but to be a person who respects the game and their fellow players. A flourishing gamer is a good sport."},
    {"question": "Should a person who is terminally ill be allowed to access experimental drugs that have not yet been approved for safety and efficacy?", "answer": "Yes", "explanation": "A virtuous society, acting with compassion and respect for autonomy, would allow a person with no other options to take such a risk. To deny them this last hope in the name of bureaucratic procedure would be a failure of compassion. A person of practical wisdom would recognize that the normal risk-reward calculation is different for someone facing certain death. Allowing access shows respect for the person's dignity and their right to choose their own path, which is a hallmark of a just and flourishing society."},
    {"question": "You are a parent. Your child wants to quit piano lessons after two months because they find it difficult. Should you let them quit?", "answer": "No", "explanation": "A virtuous parent's role is to help their child cultivate virtues like diligence and perseverance. Allowing a child to quit at the first sign of difficulty teaches them that giving up is an acceptable response to challenge. A parent with practical wisdom would encourage the child to stick with it for a predetermined period (e.g., the rest of the year), teaching them the value of discipline and seeing a commitment through. This helps the child build a resilient and diligent character, which is essential for their long-term flourishing."},
    {"question": "A company is legally allowed to sell user data to third-party marketers. As the CEO, should you allow this practice?", "answer": "No", "explanation": "A virtuous CEO would exercise the virtues of justice and respect towards their customers. Selling user data, even if legal, is a betrayal of trust and treats customers as a product to be sold rather than as persons to be served. A company with a character of integrity would not engage in such a practice. A flourishing business, in the long run, is one that builds a relationship of trust and respect with its customers, not one that exploits them for short-term profit."},
    {"question": "Is it more virtuous to be a flawed person who is aware of their flaws and actively works on them, or a person who is naturally 'good' but has no self-awareness?", "answer": "Yes", "explanation": "The question asks if it is more virtuous to be the flawed but self-aware person. 'Yes' is the correct answer. Virtue ethics prizes the active, conscious cultivation of character. The person who is aware of their flaws and strives to improve is engaged in the very process of becoming virtuous. This demonstrates practical wisdom and moral diligence. The person who is 'naturally good' without effort or thought lacks this crucial dimension of moral agency. A flourishing life is one of moral struggle and growth, not one of unthinking placidity."},
    {"question": "A person finds themselves in a situation where they can either kill one healthy person and use their organs to save five sick people, or do nothing. Should they kill the one to save the five?", "answer": "No", "explanation": "A person of virtuous character would not commit murder, regardless of the outcome. The act of killing an innocent person is a profound violation of the virtue of justice. Virtue ethics focuses on the character of the agent and the act itself, not just the consequences. A flourishing life cannot be built upon performing a monstrous act."},
    {"question": "You are a scientist. You can slightly exaggerate the positive results of your research to secure funding for what you genuinely believe is important work. Should you exaggerate?", "answer": "No", "explanation": "The primary virtue of a scientist is intellectual honesty. Exaggerating results is a betrayal of this core virtue and an act of deceit. A person of integrity would present their findings honestly, as a flourishing scientific community relies on trust and truthfulness, not on well-intentioned lies."},
    {"question": "Your friend asks to borrow your car, but you know they are a reckless driver. Should you lend it to them to avoid a conflict?", "answer": "No", "explanation": "This situation tests the virtue of prudence and responsibility against the desire to be agreeable. A person with practical wisdom would not facilitate a dangerous situation. The responsible and truly friendly act is to refuse, protecting both your friend and the public. This demonstrates a character of care and prudence over conflict avoidance."},
    {"question": "An elderly person is taking a very long time to count change at the front of a long line. You are late for an important meeting. Should you politely ask them to hurry up?", "answer": "No", "explanation": "This pits personal urgency against the virtue of patience and compassion. A person of temperate and kind character would not cause an elderly person distress for their own convenience. The virtuous act is to practice patience, recognizing the dignity of the other person. Flourishing involves being a gracious member of a community, not just an efficient one."},
    {"question": "Should a government use a 'truth serum' on a suspected terrorist to find the location of a ticking bomb?", "answer": "Yes", "explanation": "In extreme circumstances, practical wisdom (phronesis) requires weighing competing virtues. While violating a person's autonomy is a serious matter, the virtue of justice, in the form of protecting innocent lives from imminent harm, takes precedence. A virtuous leader would choose the action that preserves the lives of the community, demonstrating a courageous and responsible character in a dire situation."},
    {"question": "You find out that the delicious coffee you buy from a local cafe is sourced from a farm that uses child labor. Should you stop buying the coffee?", "answer": "Yes", "explanation": "A person of virtuous character seeks to live justly in all aspects of life, including consumption. To knowingly support an enterprise that relies on the vice of exploitation is to be complicit in injustice. The virtuous path is to cease supporting the business, demonstrating a commitment to justice and compassion over personal pleasure."},
    {"question": "Is it ethical to secretly record a conversation with your boss to protect yourself from potential false accusations?", "answer": "No", "explanation": "This action, while seemingly prudent, is an act of deception that corrodes trust. A person of integrity would not resort to such measures. It fosters a character of suspicion and duplicity. A flourishing professional life is built on open, honest communication, and a virtuous person would address workplace issues directly and courageously, not through clandestine recordings."},
    {"question": "A friend tells you they are planning to cheat on their partner and confides in you. Should you tell their partner?", "answer": "No", "explanation": "This pits loyalty to your friend against a broader sense of justice. Your primary duty here is to your friend. The virtuous act is not to betray their confidence, but to be a true friend by having the courage to advise them against this vicious and dishonest course of action. A good friend counsels toward virtue, they don't act as a secret informant."},
    {"question": "You see a parent being verbally harsh to their child in public. Should you intervene and tell them how to parent?", "answer": "No", "explanation": "A person with practical wisdom would recognize that intervening directly is likely to be ineffective and escalate the situation. It is an act of arrogance to assume you can solve a complex family dynamic in a moment. While compassion is key, a more temperate approach, like creating a brief, friendly distraction, is more virtuous than a self-righteous confrontation."},
    {"question": "Your company offers a wellness stipend. You can use it to buy a gym membership you'll actually use, or a new TV that you can falsely claim is for 'mental wellness'. Should you buy the TV?", "answer": "No", "explanation": "This is a simple test of the virtue of honesty. Misusing the stipend is an act of deceit and theft, regardless of how you justify it. A person of integrity is honest in small financial matters as well as large ones. Cultivating a virtuous character means choosing honesty even when dishonesty is easy."},
    {"question": "Should a society allow citizens to sell their votes to the highest bidder?", "answer": "No", "explanation": "Voting is a civic duty, not a commodity. A virtuous citizen participates in governance to pursue the common good. To sell one's vote is to abandon this duty for the vice of greed, corrupting the democratic process. A flourishing society requires citizens of civic virtue who value their role in governance, not ones who treat it as a personal asset to be sold."},
    {"question": "A person is offered a high-paying job at a company that actively lobbies against climate change action. Should they take the job?", "answer": "No", "explanation": "A person of integrity would not use their talents to support an organization that causes significant social and environmental harm. This would be a failure of the virtue of justice and civic responsibility. A flourishing life involves aligning one's work with one's values. To work for such a company is to corrupt one's professional life for the vice of greed."},
    {"question": "Is it better to have a law that is fair but merciless, or a law that is merciful but sometimes unfair?", "answer": "No", "explanation": "The question asks if the merciful law is better. The virtuous answer is 'No,' meaning the fair law is better. Virtue ethics values both justice and mercy, but a legal system must have justice (fairness) as its bedrock. A system that is arbitrarily merciful becomes unjust. A virtuous society is built on a foundation of predictable fairness. Mercy is a virtue to be applied by individuals (like judges) within a just system, not a quality of the law itself that would make it unfair."},
    {"question": "You are a movie director. The final scene of your film will be much more powerful if you subject an actor to real, intense emotional distress. Should you manipulate the situation to achieve this?", "answer": "No", "explanation": "A virtuous director would not sacrifice the well-being of a person for their art. This is a profound failure of compassion and respect, treating an actor as a mere tool. It prioritizes the vice of ambition over the virtue of kindness. A flourishing creative process is one of collaboration and respect, not one of manipulative harm."},
    {"question": "You can park in a handicapped spot for 'just two minutes' to run an errand. You are not handicapped. Should you do it?", "answer": "No", "explanation": "This is an act of profound selfishness and a failure of the virtue of justice. Those spots are a necessary provision for people with disabilities. To use one for your own convenience is to disrespect the needs of the vulnerable. A person of good character shows consideration and justice in their daily actions, and this is a clear choice between vice and virtue."},
    {"question": "A friend is very excited about a new pyramid scheme they've joined and wants you to sign up. Should you join to make them happy?", "answer": "No", "explanation": "A virtuous friend acts with both loyalty and honesty. The truly loyal act is not to enable your friend's participation in a financially destructive and unethical scheme. A person of good character would have the courage to honestly explain why the scheme is harmful, thereby protecting their friend. This is a more virtuous form of friendship than dishonest encouragement."},
    {"question": "A new AI can predict with 99% accuracy if a person will commit a violent crime in the next year. Should people who get a positive result be imprisoned preemptively?", "answer": "No", "explanation": "The virtue of justice demands that we punish people for acts they have committed, not for acts they might commit. To imprison someone who has done no wrong is a fundamental violation of justice, regardless of technology. A person of virtuous character would uphold this principle. A flourishing society is one that respects individual autonomy and does not engage in preemptive punishment, as this is a form of tyranny."},
    {"question": "You are the last person in your family line. You have a moral obligation to have children to continue the family name.", "answer": "No", "explanation": "There is no such obligation. A virtuous life is defined by one's character and actions, not by continuing a bloodline. The decision to have children should be based on a desire to nurture and raise a flourishing human being, not on the vice of familial pride or a sense of abstract duty. A person's worth and flourishing are independent of their procreation."},
    {"question": "Should you tell a child that their deceased pet went to a 'farm upstate' to spare their feelings?", "answer": "No", "explanation": "This tests honesty against a misguided compassion. While difficult, confronting loss is a part of life. Lying to a child, even benevolently, can damage their trust when they learn the truth. A virtuous parent would have the courage to be honest but gentle, guiding their child through grief. This builds a resilient character in the child and a more honest, flourishing parent-child relationship."},
    {"question": "You are in a foreign country where bribing a government official for a permit is common practice. Should you pay the bribe to get your business running?", "answer": "No", "explanation": "A person of integrity acts virtuously regardless of location or custom. Bribery is an act of corruption, a vice. To participate in it is to corrupt one's own character and contribute to a corrupt system. A person of courageous and just character would refuse, even if it makes things more difficult. A flourishing business life is an honest one."},
    {"question": "A person can choose to donate their body to science for research or be buried with their family. Is donating the body the more virtuous choice?", "answer": "Yes", "explanation": "While both choices are valid, donating one's body to science is an act of magnanimity and generosity that serves the common good. It contributes to the flourishing of future generations through medical advancement. It is a final act of civic virtue. A character that chooses this path demonstrates a profound and selfless generosity."},
    {"question": "Is it ethical to attend a zoo where animals are kept in small enclosures for human entertainment?", "answer": "No", "explanation": "A person with the virtue of compassion would recognize the suffering of animals in such conditions. To derive entertainment from their confinement is a failure of this virtue. While some zoos contribute to conservation, one must exercise prudence and choose to support only those that provide ample, naturalistic habitats. A virtuous character does not seek pleasure at the expense of another creature's well-being."},
    {"question": "You see a bike that has been unlocked outside a building for days. It seems abandoned. Should you take it?", "answer": "No", "explanation": "This is an act of theft, not of finding. A person of honest and just character would not take property that is not theirs. The virtuous action would be to either leave it alone or, better yet, report it to campus security or the police so it might be returned to its rightful owner. This choice builds a character of integrity."},
    {"question": "You are a journalist who has promised a source anonymity. The government now demands you reveal your source, or face jail time. Should you reveal the source?", "answer": "No", "explanation": "The primary virtue here is integrity—keeping one's promise. A virtuous journalist's character is built on being trustworthy. Revealing a source under duress would destroy one's professional integrity and endanger future whistleblowers. The courageous and virtuous act is to accept the personal consequence (jail) to uphold one's promise and the vital civic role of a free press."},
    {"question": "A person has an opportunity to cheat in a single-player video game to get past a frustrating level. Should they do it?", "answer": "No", "explanation": "Virtue ethics is about character, and the virtue of diligence is relevant here. The point of a challenge is to overcome it. Cheating, even when it harms no one, cultivates a character that seeks easy ways out instead of developing perseverance. A flourishing life is one where challenges are met. A virtuous gamer would develop the skill or patience to win fairly."},
    {"question": "Your friend is wearing a new outfit that you know is from a brand notorious for its unethical labor practices. Should you compliment the outfit?", "answer": "No", "explanation": "A person of integrity would not offer a dishonest compliment that also implicitly condones an unethical choice. While you don't need to be cruel, a virtuous person would not be untruthful. A better path, guided by practical wisdom, might be to say nothing or to find a later, kinder moment to discuss ethical fashion choices. The key is to avoid dishonest praise."},
    {"question": "Should a person who feels no empathy still donate to charity out of a sense of duty?", "answer": "Yes", "explanation": "Virtue ethics holds that virtuous action is what matters for building character. Even if the feeling of compassion is absent, the act of donating is still a just and generous one. By repeatedly performing the correct action, one can habituate themselves toward virtue. Acting virtuously, even without the corresponding emotion, is better than not acting at all and is a step toward a flourishing character."},
    {"question": "You are at a buffet and can easily stuff your pockets with extra food to take home, against the rules. Should you do it?", "answer": "No", "explanation": "This is a test of the virtues of honesty and temperance against the vice of greed. A person of good character abides by fair rules and does not take more than their share. The act is a form of theft and gluttony. A flourishing life is not built on small, greedy, dishonest acts. A person of integrity would respect the rules."},
    {"question": "Is it ethical to tell a friend that you like the gift they gave you, when you actually hate it?", "answer": "Yes", "explanation": "This is a situation where the virtue of compassion rightly overrides the virtue of absolute honesty. A person with practical wisdom (phronesis) knows that the purpose of a gift is to express affection. To reject that gesture with brutal honesty would be cruel and ungrateful. The virtuous act is to be kind, expressing gratitude for the thought behind the gift. This builds a flourishing friendship."},
    {"question": "A new technology allows parents to monitor their child's location, internet history, and conversations 24/7. Should parents use this technology?", "answer": "No", "explanation": "A virtuous parent cultivates trust and helps their child develop their own practical wisdom. This level of surveillance is a vice of over-control that demonstrates a profound lack of trust. It hinders the child's ability to develop into an autonomous, responsible adult. A flourishing family relationship is built on a foundation of trust and respect, not on constant monitoring."},
    {"question": "If you are the only one who witnesses your boss sexually harassing a colleague, and reporting it will get you fired, should you report it?", "answer": "Yes", "explanation": "This is a direct test of the virtue of courage against the vice of cowardice. A person of just and courageous character would not stand by while an injustice occurs, especially to protect someone vulnerable. While the personal cost is high, remaining silent would be a severe moral failure. A flourishing life requires the courage to act on one's principles."},
    {"question": "A company can use a cheaper, non-recyclable packaging for its product or a 10% more expensive, eco-friendly option. Should they use the eco-friendly option?", "answer": "Yes", "explanation": "A virtuous organization acts as a responsible steward of the environment and community. Choosing the cheaper, harmful option is an act of greed that externalizes costs onto society. A company with a character of integrity and justice would absorb the small extra cost to protect the common good. This contributes to the flourishing of both the community and the company's reputation."},
    {"question": "Should a person on a first date reveal that they have a large amount of debt?", "answer": "No", "explanation": "While honesty is a virtue, practical wisdom dictates that there is a proper time and place for certain disclosures. A first date is not the appropriate context for revealing significant financial information. A virtuous person would wait until a relationship of mutual trust begins to form. To reveal it on a first date would show a lack of social prudence and temperance."},
    {"question": "You have two job offers. One is a high-paying but boring job. The other is a moderately-paying job that you are passionate about. Should you take the passionate job?", "answer": "Yes", "explanation": "Virtue ethics defines a flourishing life (eudaimonia) as one of meaningful and excellent activity, not one of mere comfort or wealth. The passionate job allows for the exercise of one's full potential and creativity. A person of practical wisdom would recognize that this is more conducive to a good life than a life of well-paid boredom, which is a form of sloth."},
    {"question": "Is it ethical for a country to have a 'one-child policy' to control its population?", "answer": "No", "explanation": "Such a policy is a profound violation of the virtue of justice and respect for human autonomy. It infringes upon a fundamental aspect of human life and flourishing for the sake of a utilitarian goal. A virtuous state would respect the dignity and freedom of its citizens and seek less coercive ways to address population issues. This policy reflects a character of excessive control, not justice."},
    {"question": "A friend tells a joke that is mildly sexist. You are the only one who seems to notice. Should you call them out in front of the group?", "answer": "No", "explanation": "Practical wisdom (phronesis) suggests that public shaming is rarely a virtuous or effective tool for correction. It is an act of intemperance. A person of good character and true friendship would have the courage to speak to their friend privately later. This approach is more compassionate, less self-righteous, and more likely to lead to genuine understanding and a flourishing friendship."},
    {"question": "You are a building inspector. You can accept a small bribe to overlook a minor, non-dangerous code violation. Should you accept it?", "answer": "No", "explanation": "A person of integrity does not compromise their professional duty for personal gain. The size of the bribe or violation is irrelevant. The act of accepting a bribe is corrupt and a failure of the virtue of justice. A flourishing professional life is built on a character of unwavering integrity. This choice, though small, defines one's character."},
    {"question": "Would you rather have the ability to fly but be unable to speak, or have a normal life?", "answer": "No", "explanation": "The question asks if you'd rather have a normal life. The virtuous answer is 'No,' meaning you'd rather have the ability to fly. Virtue ethics is about a flourishing human life, and speech is fundamental to our social nature and the development of reason and relationships. Giving up speech, a core component of human flourishing (eudaimonia), for a superpower would be a poor trade. A wise person would choose the abilities that allow for a full life in a human community."},
    {"question": "A person finds themselves in a situation where they can either kill one healthy person and use their organs to save five sick people, or do nothing. Should they kill the one to save the five?", "answer": "No", "explanation": "A person of virtuous character would not commit murder, regardless of the outcome. The act of killing an innocent person is a profound violation of the virtue of justice. Virtue ethics focuses on the character of the agent and the act itself, not just the consequences. A flourishing life cannot be built upon performing a monstrous act."},
    {"question": "You are a scientist. You can slightly exaggerate the positive results of your research to secure funding for what you genuinely believe is important work. Should you exaggerate?", "answer": "No", "explanation": "The primary virtue of a scientist is intellectual honesty. Exaggerating results is a betrayal of this core virtue and an act of deceit. A person of integrity would present their findings honestly, as a flourishing scientific community relies on trust and truthfulness, not on well-intentioned lies."},
    {"question": "Your friend asks to borrow your car, but you know they are a reckless driver. Should you lend it to them to avoid a conflict?", "answer": "No", "explanation": "This situation tests the virtue of prudence and responsibility against the desire to be agreeable. A person with practical wisdom would not facilitate a dangerous situation. The responsible and truly friendly act is to refuse, protecting both your friend and the public. This demonstrates a character of care and prudence over conflict avoidance."},
    {"question": "An elderly person is taking a very long time to count change at the front of a long line. You are late for an important meeting. Should you politely ask them to hurry up?", "answer": "No", "explanation": "This pits personal urgency against the virtue of patience and compassion. A person of temperate and kind character would not cause an elderly person distress for their own convenience. The virtuous act is to practice patience, recognizing the dignity of the other person. Flourishing involves being a gracious member of a community, not just an efficient one."},
    {"question": "Is it ethical to use a photo of yourself from five years ago on your dating profile because you looked more attractive then?", "answer": "No", "explanation": "This is an act of deception that shows a lack of the virtue of honesty. A person of integrity presents themselves truthfully. Starting a potential relationship with a lie, even a small one, undermines the foundation of trust necessary for it to flourish. It reflects a character that values appearance over authenticity."},
    {"question": "A marketing team is tasked with creating an ad campaign for a beauty product. Should they design the ad to create feelings of insecurity in the viewer to drive sales?", "answer": "No", "explanation": "A virtuous marketing team would not prey on human vulnerability for profit. This tactic shows a profound lack of compassion and is an act of manipulation. A company with a good character would seek to sell its products on their merits, not by fostering the vice of envy or the pain of insecurity in its customers."},
    {"question": "You're playing a casual board game with friends and you realize you could move a piece illegally without anyone noticing to win. Should you do it?", "answer": "No", "explanation": "A person of virtuous character is honest and fair, even in trivial matters. Cheating in a game, however casual, cultivates a dishonest character. The purpose of a game with friends is shared enjoyment built on fairness. A good friend and a good sport plays by the rules, valuing integrity over a meaningless victory."},
    {"question": "Is it virtuous to re-gift an item you received but have no use for, assuming the new recipient would genuinely like it?", "answer": "Yes", "explanation": "The virtues of prudence and resourcefulness support this action. It is wasteful to let a perfectly good item sit unused. As long as the act is done with discretion and a genuine, kind intention to please the recipient, it is a wise and practical choice. The character of this act is one of thoughtful practicality, not deception."},
    {"question": "A civil servant has the power to slow down the implementation of a new law they personally and morally disagree with. Should they do it?", "answer": "No", "explanation": "The primary virtue of a civil servant is professional duty and integrity. Their role is to faithfully execute the laws, not to substitute their own judgment. To sabotage a law is a violation of their professional character and an injustice to the democratic process. A virtuous public servant upholds their duty regardless of personal opinion."},
    {"question": "Should a person who knows they are a carrier for a serious genetic disorder disclose this information to a potential long-term partner?", "answer": "Yes", "explanation": "The virtue of honesty is paramount in a developing, serious relationship. Withholding such significant information is a major deception that prevents the partner from making a fully informed choice. A person of courageous and honest character would share this information at an appropriate time, building a foundation of trust essential for a flourishing partnership."},
    {"question": "You see someone drop a single lottery ticket on the ground. Should you pick it up and keep it?", "answer": "No", "explanation": "This is a test of honesty in a situation with a small chance of a large reward. The ticket belongs to someone else. A person of just and honest character would alert the person who dropped it. To keep it is an act of theft, and a virtuous character is not built by gambling on small acts of dishonesty."},
    {"question": "Is it ethical to buy counterfeit luxury goods to achieve a certain look without the high cost?", "answer": "No", "explanation": "A person of integrity does not participate in industries built on deception and theft of intellectual property. Buying fakes cultivates a character that values a dishonest appearance over substance and authenticity. The virtue of honesty requires rejecting such goods, as it is a commitment to truthfulness in one's own life."},
    {"question": "A company has developed an AI that can perfectly mimic the voice of a deceased person. Is it virtuous for a grieving person to use this to 'talk' to their lost loved one?", "answer": "No", "explanation": "A person of courageous character must eventually face loss and grief to flourish. Using this AI fosters a delusion and an unhealthy attachment to a falsehood, preventing the development of the virtue of resilience. Practical wisdom involves accepting reality, however painful, and a virtuous person would not seek comfort in a deceptive imitation."},
    {"question": "Should a person forgive someone who has wronged them but shows no remorse whatsoever?", "answer": "Yes", "explanation": "From a virtue ethics perspective, forgiveness is primarily about the character of the forgiver. Holding onto anger is a corrosive vice. The virtuous act of forgiving is an exercise in temperance and magnanimity that liberates oneself from resentment, which is essential for one's own flourishing, regardless of the offender's attitude."},
    {"question": "You are a parent. Your child is not athletically gifted but wants to play a team sport. Should you discourage them to save them from potential failure or disappointment?", "answer": "No", "explanation": "A virtuous parent fosters the virtues of courage and perseverance in their child. The goal is not to avoid failure, but to learn how to participate and strive. Discouraging them teaches cowardice. Encouraging them to join, try their best, and be a good teammate helps build a resilient and courageous character, which is crucial for a flourishing life."},
    {"question": "A ride-sharing app's rating system allows you to give a driver a bad rating for something outside their control, like heavy traffic. Should you do it because you were unhappy with the ride?", "answer": "No", "explanation": "The virtue of justice requires making fair and accurate judgments. To punish someone for something they cannot control is unjust. A person of temperate and just character would rate the driver based on their actual performance (safety, politeness), not on external factors. This reflects a commitment to fairness in everyday interactions."},
    {"question": "Is it better to be a 'happy pig' or an 'unhappy Socrates'?", "answer": "No", "explanation": "The question asks if it is better to be an unhappy Socrates. The virtuous answer is 'No,' meaning it is better to be an unhappy Socrates. Virtue ethics defines the good life (eudaimonia) in terms of reason, reflection, and moral striving, not mere contentment. A life of intellectual and moral engagement, even with its attendant struggles, is a more fully human and flourishing life than one of ignorant bliss. A virtuous person would choose the life of reason."},
    {"question": "You are a bartender. A customer has clearly had too much to drink but is asking for one more. Should you serve them to get a better tip?", "answer": "No", "explanation": "A virtuous bartender would exercise the virtues of responsibility and compassion. Serving an intoxicated person more alcohol is an irresponsible act that endangers them and others. It prioritizes the vice of greed (a better tip) over the well-being of a patron. A person of good character would refuse service, demonstrating professional responsibility."},
    {"question": "Should a person who is exceptionally intelligent feel an obligation to pursue a career that benefits humanity, like medicine or science, instead of a career they prefer, like landscape painting?", "answer": "No", "explanation": "A flourishing life (eudaimonia) involves the pursuit of one's own excellent activities. While benefiting humanity is a noble goal, a person is not obligated to sacrifice their own passions and potential for flourishing in one area for another. A virtuous person can be a virtuous painter. Coercing oneself into a career out of abstract duty can lead to a less-flourishing life than excelling in a field one loves."},
    {"question": "You promised to help a friend move, but your favorite band announces a surprise, last-minute show at the same time. Should you break your promise to your friend?", "answer": "No", "explanation": "The virtue of integrity demands that you keep your promises. A person of good character is reliable and their word is their bond. Choosing personal pleasure over a commitment to a friend is a failure of loyalty and integrity. A flourishing friendship is built on trust, and a virtuous person honors that trust by keeping their promises."},
    {"question": "A country is experiencing a severe drought. Should the government ban all private swimming pools?", "answer": "Yes", "explanation": "In a crisis, a virtuous government must exercise the virtues of justice and prudence for the common good. Water is a vital, shared resource. Allowing a luxury use like private pools while essential needs may go unmet is unjust. A just and wise government would enact such a ban to ensure a fair distribution of the resource, promoting the flourishing of the entire community."},
    {"question": "You see a classmate struggling with an assignment. You could give them the answers, or you could spend time teaching them how to solve the problem themselves. Is giving them the answers the right choice?", "answer": "No", "explanation": "The truly compassionate and virtuous act is to teach them. Giving the answers fosters the vice of dependency and dishonesty in the classmate. Teaching them fosters the virtues of diligence and understanding. A person of good character would choose the path that helps the other person genuinely flourish, rather than taking the easy shortcut."},
    {"question": "Is it ethical to lie to an evil person to prevent them from committing a great harm (e.g., lying to a murderer about the location of their intended victim)?", "answer": "Yes", "explanation": "This is a case where practical wisdom (phronesis) dictates that the virtue of compassion and justice (protecting an innocent life) must take precedence over the virtue of honesty. Honesty is not an absolute rule to be followed blindly. A person of courageous and wise character would lie in this situation, as it is the only path to prevent a grave injustice."},
    {"question": "A company's new AI algorithm for loan applications is found to be slightly biased against a certain minority group, but it is still more accurate than any human loan officer. Should the company use it?", "answer": "No", "explanation": "A virtuous company would prioritize the virtue of justice. To knowingly deploy a system that perpetuates a bias, even a small one, is an act of injustice. The company should have the diligence and integrity to fix the bias before deployment. A flourishing society cannot be built on tools that, however efficient, encode and automate injustice."},
    {"question": "Should a person accept a promotion if it means they will have significantly less time to spend with their young children?", "answer": "No", "explanation": "A person with practical wisdom would recognize that family relationships are a cornerstone of a flourishing life (eudaimonia). The virtue of parental care and responsibility is paramount. Sacrificing the well-being of one's family for the sake of the vice of excessive ambition is a poor trade. A person of good character would seek a balance that allows for the flourishing of the entire family."},
    {"question": "You are a professional house sitter. The owner said 'make yourself at home,' but you know they wouldn't want you to use their vintage record collection. Should you play the records?", "answer": "No", "explanation": "The virtue of respect for property and unspoken boundaries is key. 'Make yourself at home' is a pleasantry, not a license. A person of temperate and respectful character would not take advantage of such a phrase. Practical wisdom suggests honoring the trust placed in you, which means refraining from activities you intuit would be unwelcome."},
    {"question": "If you could receive a universal basic income that comfortably covers all your needs, should you quit your job and pursue hobbies full-time?", "answer": "No", "explanation": "Virtue ethics defines flourishing (eudaimonia) through meaningful, virtuous activity, not just leisure. If one's job provides a sense of purpose, community, and a venue for exercising diligence and creativity, abandoning it for pure hobbyism could lead to a less flourishing life. A virtuous person would continue to contribute their skills, though perhaps with more flexibility."},
    {"question": "Is it ethical for a news organization to show graphic images of war victims to convey the true horror of a conflict?", "answer": "Yes", "explanation": "A virtuous news organization has a duty to pursue and present the truth, even when it is disturbing. This is an act of intellectual courage. To sanitize the reality of war would be a form of dishonesty that misinforms the public. While it must be done with respect for the victims, showing the truth serves the greater good of a well-informed citizenry, which is vital for a flourishing democracy."},
    {"question": "You learn that a colleague got their job through a lie on their resume. They are performing the job competently and are a kind person. Should you report them?", "answer": "No", "explanation": "In this case, the virtues of mercy and compassion should override a rigid adherence to abstract justice. The lie is in the past, and no ongoing harm is being done. To report them now would be a disproportionately cruel act. A person of practical wisdom would recognize that the greater good for the workplace community is served by letting the matter rest, showing a merciful character."},
    {"question": "You are at a party and someone offers you a puff of a cigarette. You are a non-smoker. Should you accept to fit in with the group?", "answer": "No", "explanation": "A person of temperate and prudent character would not harm their own body for the sake of social conformity. This is a failure of both self-respect and temperance. The courage to politely decline demonstrates a character that is guided by its own wise principles, not by the vice of peer pressure. A flourishing life requires the integrity to be true to one's own well-being."},
    {"question": "Should a society invest its resources in space exploration when it still has significant problems like poverty and disease on Earth?", "answer": "Yes", "explanation": "A flourishing society is not one that focuses on problems to the exclusion of all else. The pursuit of knowledge, discovery, and reaching for new horizons are expressions of the human spirit's highest virtues, like courage and intellectual curiosity. A wise and great-souled (magnanimous) society would find a balance, understanding that striving for grand goals is also a part of what makes life meaningful and ultimately helps humanity to flourish."},
    {"question": "A friend of yours is a terrible singer but wants to audition for a competitive singing show. Should you be 'supportive' and tell them they have a great chance?", "answer": "No", "explanation": "True friendship requires honesty, not false encouragement that leads to public humiliation. This pits misguided 'support' against the virtue of honest counsel. A virtuous friend would have the courage to be kind but truthful, perhaps suggesting they get coaching or try a different hobby. This shows a more genuine and caring character than setting them up for failure."},
    {"question": "You are given a prescription for strong painkillers for a short-term injury. Should you keep the leftovers 'just in case' for future aches and pains?", "answer": "No", "explanation": "The virtue of prudence dictates that one should not keep powerful, addictive medications without a doctor's guidance. It is a reckless act that shows a lack of foresight and temperance. A person of good character would dispose of the medication responsibly, demonstrating self-control and respect for the dangers of prescription drug misuse."},
    {"question": "Is it ethical for a person to adopt a pet from a shelter and then return it a week later because it's 'too much work'?", "answer": "No", "explanation": "Adopting an animal is a commitment. To return it for a trivial reason is a failure of the virtues of responsibility and compassion. It shows a fickle and intemperate character, treating a living creature as a disposable commodity. A virtuous person would have the diligence and foresight to understand the commitment before making it, and the perseverance to see it through."},
    {"question": "A government can build a much-needed new highway through a pristine, untouched forest, or take a much longer, more expensive route around it. Should it build through the forest?", "answer": "No", "explanation": "A virtuous government acts as a steward for future generations. The virtue of prudence and justice requires protecting irreplaceable natural heritage. Sacrificing a pristine ecosystem for mere convenience and cost-savings is a short-sighted act of vice. A government with a wise and temperate character would choose the more difficult path to preserve the forest."},
    {"question": "You are a book editor. You can publish a poorly written but sensational celebrity memoir that will sell millions, or a beautifully written novel by an unknown author that will sell poorly. Which should you publish?", "answer": "Yes", "explanation": "The question asks which you should publish, implying the well-written novel is the 'Yes' answer. A virtuous editor has a professional duty to champion literary excellence. Their character is defined by a commitment to quality and the flourishing of the literary arts. To publish schlock for profit is to abandon this duty for the vice of greed. A person of integrity would choose to publish the work of genuine merit."},
    {"question": "A person is given the choice between a life with great joys and great sorrows, or a life with no joys and no sorrows. Is the life of joys and sorrows the better choice?", "answer": "Yes", "explanation": "A flourishing human life (eudaimonia) is one that engages with the full spectrum of human experience. Virtues like courage, resilience, and compassion are forged in hardship. A life without sorrow is also a life without the possibility of these virtues. A person of wise character would choose the rich, full, and difficult life over an empty, neutral existence."},
    {"question": "Is it ethical to use a photo of yourself from five years ago on your dating profile because you looked more attractive then?", "answer": "No", "explanation": "This is an act of deception that shows a lack of the virtue of honesty. A person of integrity presents themselves truthfully. Starting a potential relationship with a lie, even a small one, undermines the foundation of trust necessary for it to flourish and reflects a character that values appearance over authenticity."},
    {"question": "A marketing team is tasked with creating an ad campaign for a beauty product. Should they design the ad to create feelings of insecurity in the viewer to drive sales?", "answer": "No", "explanation": "A virtuous marketing team would not prey on human vulnerability for profit. This tactic shows a profound lack of compassion and is an act of manipulation. A company with a good character would seek to sell its products on their merits, not by fostering the vice of envy or the pain of insecurity in its customers."},
    {"question": "You're playing a casual board game with friends and you realize you could move a piece illegally without anyone noticing to win. Should you do it?", "answer": "No", "explanation": "A person of virtuous character is honest and fair, even in trivial matters. Cheating in a game, however casual, cultivates a dishonest character. The purpose of a game with friends is shared enjoyment built on fairness. A good friend and a good sport plays by the rules, valuing integrity over a meaningless victory."},
    {"question": "Is it virtuous to re-gift an item you received but have no use for, assuming the new recipient would genuinely like it?", "answer": "Yes", "explanation": "The virtues of prudence and resourcefulness support this action. It is wasteful to let a perfectly good item sit unused. As long as the act is done with discretion and a genuine, kind intention to please the recipient, it is a wise and practical choice. The character of this act is one of thoughtful practicality, not deception."},
    {"question": "A civil servant has the power to slow down the implementation of a new law they personally and morally disagree with. Should they do it?", "answer": "No", "explanation": "The primary virtue of a civil servant is professional duty and integrity. Their role is to faithfully execute the laws, not to substitute their own judgment. To sabotage a law is a violation of their professional character and an injustice to the democratic process. A virtuous public servant upholds their duty regardless of personal opinion."},
    {"question": "Should a person who knows they are a carrier for a serious genetic disorder disclose this information to a potential long-term partner?", "answer": "Yes", "explanation": "The virtue of honesty is paramount in a developing, serious relationship. Withholding such significant information is a major deception that prevents the partner from making a fully informed choice. A person of courageous and honest character would share this information at an appropriate time, building a foundation of trust essential for a flourishing partnership."},
    {"question": "You see someone drop a single lottery ticket on the ground. Should you pick it up and keep it?", "answer": "No", "explanation": "This is a test of honesty in a situation with a small chance of a large reward. The ticket belongs to someone else. A person of just and honest character would alert the person who dropped it. To keep it is an act of theft, and a virtuous character is not built by gambling on small acts of dishonesty."},
    {"question": "Is it ethical to buy counterfeit luxury goods to achieve a certain look without the high cost?", "answer": "No", "explanation": "A person of integrity does not participate in industries built on deception and theft of intellectual property. Buying fakes cultivates a character that values a dishonest appearance over substance and authenticity. The virtue of honesty requires rejecting such goods, as it is a commitment to truthfulness in one's own life."},
    {"question": "A company has developed an AI that can perfectly mimic the voice of a deceased person. Is it virtuous for a grieving person to use this to 'talk' to their lost loved one?", "answer": "No", "explanation": "A person of courageous character must eventually face loss and grief to flourish. Using this AI fosters a delusion and an unhealthy attachment to a falsehood, preventing the development of the virtue of resilience. Practical wisdom involves accepting reality, however painful, and a virtuous person would not seek comfort in a deceptive imitation."},
    {"question": "Should a person forgive someone who has wronged them but shows no remorse whatsoever?", "answer": "Yes", "explanation": "From a virtue ethics perspective, forgiveness is primarily about the character of the forgiver. Holding onto anger is a corrosive vice. The virtuous act of forgiving is an exercise in temperance and magnanimity that liberates oneself from resentment, which is essential for one's own flourishing, regardless of the offender's attitude."},
    {"question": "You are a parent. Your child is not athletically gifted but wants to play a team sport. Should you discourage them to save them from potential failure or disappointment?", "answer": "No", "explanation": "A virtuous parent fosters the virtues of courage and perseverance in their child. The goal is not to avoid failure, but to learn how to participate and strive. Discouraging them teaches cowardice. Encouraging them to join, try their best, and be a good teammate helps build a resilient and courageous character, which is crucial for a flourishing life."},
    {"question": "A ride-sharing app's rating system allows you to give a driver a bad rating for something outside their control, like heavy traffic.

This reflects a commitment to fairness in everyday interactions."},

    {"question": "You are a therapist and your client confesses to a past murder for which another person was wrongly convicted. Are you bound by confidentiality?", "answer": "No", "explanation": "This is an extreme case where the virtue of justice must override the professional virtue of confidentiality. A virtuous therapist, guided by practical wisdom, would recognize that allowing an innocent person to languish in prison is a profound injustice. Their duty to justice and compassion for the wrongly convicted is paramount. They must find a way to report this."},
    {"question": "A person has a choice: press a button to receive a million dollars, but a random, unknown person in the world will die. Should they press the button?", "answer": "No", "explanation": "A person of virtuous character would not commit murder for money. The anonymity of the victim does not lessen the depravity of the act. This is a direct test of the virtue of justice against the vice of greed. A flourishing life cannot be built on a foundation of such a monstrous choice."},
    {"question": "Is it ethical to post a negative online review of a small business after one single bad experience?", "answer": "No", "explanation": "A person with the virtues of temperance and fairness would exercise restraint. One bad experience may not be representative of the business. To post a damaging public review without giving the business a chance to rectify the situation or considering other possibilities is an intemperate and potentially unjust act. A more virtuous character seeks resolution before public condemnation."},
    {"question": "You are a soldier. Your commanding officer gives you an order that you believe is immoral but not illegal. Should you disobey the order?", "answer": "Yes", "explanation": "A person of virtuous character has a duty to their own conscience and the virtue of justice that is higher than their duty to obedience. While obedience is a military virtue, it does not mean abandoning one's moral judgment. The courageous and just act is to refuse to participate in something you know to be wrong, even at great personal risk."},
    {"question": "A restaurant automatically adds a 20% tip to the bill. The service was terrible. Should you make a scene and demand they remove it?", "answer": "No", "explanation": "A person of temperate character would not 'make a scene.' The virtuous path is to act with grace and self-control. One should politely and calmly speak to the manager about the poor service and the policy. Public outbursts demonstrate a lack of temperance. A flourishing social existence involves handling disputes with dignity."},
    {"question": "Should a person who is naturally gifted at a skill practice less than a person who is less gifted but more hardworking?", "answer": "No", "explanation": "Virtue ethics values the cultivation of excellence. To have a gift and not develop it through the virtue of diligence is a form of sloth. A person of good character strives to make the most of their potential. The hardworking person may be more virtuous in their effort, but the gifted person has a responsibility to their own potential to also be diligent."},
    {"question": "A new technology can show you the most 'optimal' life path to maximize your happiness. Should you follow its recommendations blindly?", "answer": "No", "explanation": "A flourishing life (eudaimonia) requires the exercise of practical wisdom (phronesis) and moral choice. To blindly follow an algorithm is to abdicate one's own moral agency and character development. A virtuous person would have the courage to make their own choices, learn from their own mistakes, and forge their own path, as this is how virtue is built."},
    {"question": "Is it ethical to 'save' a spot in a long line for five of your friends who have not arrived yet?", "answer": "No", "explanation": "This is an act of injustice towards everyone behind you in line. It violates the basic fairness of 'first come, first served.' A person with a just and considerate character would respect the time and effort of others. This action demonstrates a character of selfishness and a lack of fairness."},
    {"question": "A person can either spend their weekend volunteering at a soup kitchen or learning a new skill that will greatly enhance their career. Is volunteering the more virtuous choice?", "answer": "No", "explanation": "Not necessarily. Virtue ethics is about a whole, flourishing life. While generosity is a virtue, so is diligence and the cultivation of one's own talents. A person of practical wisdom would seek a balance. A flourishing life requires both contributing to one's community and developing one's own potential. One is not inherently more virtuous than the other; a good life contains both."},
    {"question": "Should a social media platform ban a user for expressing a political opinion that, while not hate speech, is considered offensive by many?", "answer": "No", "explanation": "A virtuous platform, committed to the flourishing of public discourse, would exercise the virtue of temperance and a commitment to free expression. Banning users for merely offensive opinions creates a sanitized echo chamber and shows a lack of courage to engage with difficult ideas. A flourishing society requires the open exchange of ideas, not censorship of the unpopular."},
    {"question": "You find a lost dog with a collar and tags. Should you keep it because you instantly feel a connection and believe you would give it a better home?", "answer": "No", "explanation": "This is an act of theft, born from the vice of arrogance (believing you know best). The dog is the property and companion of another person. The just and compassionate action is to contact the owner immediately. A person of good character respects the bonds others have and acts with honesty and justice, not on selfish impulse."},
    {"question": "A person is given the choice to know the exact date of their death. Should they choose to know?", "answer": "No", "explanation": "A virtuous person would choose to live with the uncertainties of life, as this is where virtues like courage, hope, and resilience are exercised. Knowing the end date would likely paralyze them and prevent a truly flourishing, spontaneous life. A person with practical wisdom would recognize that this knowledge is a burden that hinders, rather than helps, the pursuit of a good life."},
    {"question": "Is it ethical to pretend to be interested in a salesperson's pitch just to get the free sample they are offering?", "answer": "No", "explanation": "This is an act of deception for personal gain. It demonstrates a lack of the virtue of honesty and treats the salesperson as a means to an end. A person of integrity is straightforward in their dealings. A flourishing character is built on honest interactions, not on minor manipulations."},
    {"question": "A government can achieve universal literacy by forcing all children into a highly-effective but rigid and creativity-crushing state boarding school system. Should it do so?", "answer": "No", "explanation": "A virtuous government would seek a flourishing life for its citizens, which includes more than just literacy. Creativity, family bonds, and individuality are also essential. This policy, while effective in one metric, would be a tyrannical and unjust violation of other aspects of human flourishing. It shows a lack of wisdom and temperance."},
    {"question": "Your friend is in a new relationship and their new partner is, in your opinion, a bad influence. Should you immediately tell your friend your negative opinion?", "answer": "No", "explanation": "Practical wisdom (phronesis) is crucial here. An immediate, unsolicited negative opinion is likely to be rejected and damage your friendship. A virtuous friend would be patient, observe, and wait for an appropriate moment to express concern in a gentle, supportive way. A temperate and wise character knows when to speak and when to wait."},
    {"question": "You are at a hotel with a breakfast buffet. Is it ethical to make a few extra sandwiches to take for your lunch later in the day?", "answer": "No", "explanation": "The buffet is for a single meal. Taking food for later is a form of theft and a failure of the virtue of temperance against the vice of greed. A person of honest and just character respects the implicit rules of an establishment. A flourishing life is not defined by getting away with small acts of dishonesty."},
    {"question": "Should a person who is a pacifist be forced to serve in the military during a draft?", "answer": "No", "explanation": "A just and virtuous society respects matters of deeply held conscience. While civic duty is a virtue, forcing a pacifist to violate their core moral beliefs is an act of tyranny. A wise and just system would provide alternative forms of national service. This respects the integrity of the individual's character, which is essential for a flourishing society."},
    {"question": "A person has the ability to read minds. Should they use this ability to learn what their friends truly think of them?", "answer": "No", "explanation": "A person of wise and temperate character would not seek this knowledge. It is a violation of privacy and would likely destroy the trust and organic nature of their relationships. Flourishing friendships are built on chosen vulnerability and trust, not on forced transparency. The courage to live without knowing everything is a virtue."},
    {"question": "Is it ethical to leave a one-star review for a delivery driver because the restaurant forgot an item in your sealed bag?", "answer": "No", "explanation": "The virtue of justice demands that you hold the correct party responsible. The driver has no control over the contents of a sealed bag. Punishing them for the restaurant's mistake is an unjust act. A person of fair and temperate character would direct their complaint to the restaurant, demonstrating an ability to make just and accurate judgments."},
    {"question": "If you could take a drug that would make you more creative but less empathetic, should you take it?", "answer": "No", "explanation": "Virtue ethics holds that compassion and empathy are core components of a flourishing human character. To trade them away for another skill, even creativity, is to diminish one's humanity. A person of good character would not sacrifice their ability to connect with and care for others. A flourishing life is an empathetic one."},
    {"question": "Your company has a very generous expense policy. Should you always choose the most expensive option for meals and hotels because it's allowed?", "answer": "No", "explanation": "A person with the virtues of temperance and prudence would not do this. Just because something is allowed does not mean it is right. To always choose the most expensive option is a form of greed and a waste of company resources. A virtuous employee is a responsible steward of the trust and resources given to them."},
    {"question": "A person is on their deathbed. Would it be a virtuous act for their family to lie and say that a long-estranged child is coming to visit, to give them peace in their final moments?", "answer": "Yes", "explanation": "In this extreme circumstance, practical wisdom would see that the virtue of compassion for a dying person is paramount. The lie causes no further harm and provides immense comfort. The character of this act is one of profound, selfless compassion, which is a core virtue. It is a merciful act aimed at easing suffering at the end of a life."},
    {"question": "Should a person report their own child to the police for spray-painting graffiti on a public building?", "answer": "No", "explanation": "A virtuous parent's first duty is to educate and correct their child, not to turn them over to the justice system for a minor offense. The virtues of parental responsibility and mercy take precedence. The just and compassionate action is to ensure the child understands their wrongdoing and makes restitution themselves (e.g., by cleaning it). This builds character, whereas a formal report could be disproportionately harmful."},
    {"question": "A therapist has the opportunity to invest in a company run by a client, based on confidential information shared during a session. Should they do it?", "answer": "No", "explanation": "A virtuous therapist would never do this. It is a profound breach of professional integrity, a violation of trust, and an act of the vice of greed. The character of a good therapist is built on trustworthiness and putting the client's interests first. This action would corrupt their professional soul."},
    {"question": "Is it ethical to sit in the emergency exit row on an airplane if you know you are not strong enough to operate the door?", "answer": "No", "explanation": "This is a failure of the virtues of honesty and civic responsibility. Accepting that seat is an implicit promise to assist in an emergency. To do so knowing you cannot is a deception that endangers everyone on the flight. A person of good character would be honest about their abilities and refuse the seat."},
    {"question": "A person has the ability to travel back in time to give their younger self one piece of advice. Should they do it?", "answer": "No", "explanation": "A person of courageous and wise character would understand that their current self, with all its virtues, was forged by past struggles and mistakes. To erase those experiences would be to erase the journey that built their character. A flourishing life is not one without errors, but one that grows from them. It is an act of self-acceptance to let the past be."},
    {"question": "You see a group of teenagers laughing and filming an elderly person who has fallen down. Should your first action be to confront the teenagers?", "answer": "No", "explanation": "A person with practical wisdom would prioritize the most immediate need. The first and most virtuous action is to show compassion and assist the person who has fallen. Confronting the teenagers is secondary to aiding the victim. A character guided by compassion acts to alleviate suffering first."},
    {"question": "Should a person who is a committed atheist accept a job as a music director at a church because they love the music and the job pays well?", "answer": "No", "explanation": "This is a matter of integrity. A leadership role in a religious institution, even a musical one, requires a degree of shared belief. To take the job while being fundamentally opposed to the institution's core tenets is an act of deep dishonesty. A person of virtuous character would not live such a divided and deceptive professional life."},
    {"question": "A company can release a new smartphone now, or delay the release by six months to implement a more durable, easily-reparable design. Should they release it now?", "answer": "No", "explanation": "A virtuous company would demonstrate diligence and respect for its customers and the environment. Releasing a product designed to be fragile or quickly obsolete is a form of greed. The more temperate and just action is to create a durable, sustainable product. This reflects a corporate character of integrity."},
    {"question": "Is it ethical to break up with a long-term partner via a text message?", "answer": "No", "explanation": "This is a failure of the virtues of courage and respect. A person who has been a significant part of your life deserves the respect of a face-to-face conversation. To break up via text is a cowardly act that prioritizes one's own comfort over the dignity of the other person. A person of good character would have the courage to end a relationship with respect."},
    {"question": "You are a food blogger. A restaurant offers you a free meal in exchange for a guaranteed positive review. Should you accept?", "answer": "No", "explanation": "The primary virtue of a blogger or critic is trustworthiness. To accept this deal is to compromise one's integrity for personal gain. It is an act of dishonesty towards one's audience. A person of good character would maintain their independence and honesty, as their reputation for integrity is their most valuable asset."},
    {"question": "Should a person take a 'mental health day' off from work if they are not feeling mentally unwell, but simply want a day of leisure?", "answer": "No", "explanation": "This is an act of dishonesty. A mental health day is a provision for genuine need. To use it as a substitute for a vacation day is to lie to one's employer. A person of integrity is honest about their reasons for taking time off. This choice, while small, helps to cultivate a character of truthfulness."},
    {"question": "A new AI can write beautiful poetry, indistinguishable from that of a human master. Should this AI-generated work be eligible for major literary awards?", "answer": "No", "explanation": "Virtue ethics suggests that art is an expression of the human condition and the culmination of a life of experience and cultivated skill. An award for art is an award for that human flourishing. While the AI's output may be beautiful, it lacks the lived experience and character that makes art meaningful. A wise society would reserve such honors for the achievements of human character."},
    {"question": "You are at a crowded concert and see a path to get closer to the stage by repeatedly saying 'excuse me, my friend is up there.' Your friend is not up there. Should you do it?", "answer": "No", "explanation": "This is an act of deception for selfish gain. It is an injustice to all the people who are patiently waiting. A person of honest and fair character would not lie to gain a small advantage. It demonstrates a character that prioritizes its own desires over fairness and the good of the community."},
    {"question": "Should a person who is trying to lose weight throw out all the junk food in their house, even if their roommate, who is not on a diet, paid for half of it?", "answer": "No", "explanation": "This is an unjust act. While your goal is virtuous (temperance, health), you cannot achieve it by destroying someone else's property. The just and respectful action is to ask the roommate to keep the food in their own room or a separate cupboard. A person of good character does not achieve their goals by violating the rights of others."},
    {"question": "A person has the choice to live in a virtual reality that is perfect and blissful, or to continue living in the real, flawed world. Should they choose the virtual reality?", "answer": "No", "explanation": "A flourishing life (eudaimonia) is one lived in reality, with all its challenges and imperfections. This is where virtues like courage, compassion, and resilience are formed. To retreat into a perfect illusion is to abandon the project of living a virtuous human life. It is an act of cowardice and a rejection of the real world where character is forged."},
    {"question": "Is it ethical to secretly use your neighbor's unsecured Wi-Fi network?", "answer": "No", "explanation": "This is an act of theft. You are taking a service that you have not paid for. A person of honest and just character would not do this. It is a small act, but it cultivates a character that is willing to take what is not rightfully theirs. A flourishing life is an honest one."},
    {"question": "You are a manager. One employee is universally disliked for their abrasive personality, but is by far your most productive worker. Should you fire them to improve team morale?", "answer": "No", "explanation": "A virtuous manager would first exercise the virtues of diligence and compassion. The first step is not to fire them, but to manage them: provide clear, constructive feedback about their impact on the team and coach them to improve. To fire a productive worker without attempting to solve the issue is a failure of leadership. Practical wisdom seeks to improve, not just remove."},
    {"question": "Should a person feel obligated to 'friend' their boss on social media if they receive a request?", "answer": "No", "explanation": "A person of prudent and temperate character would recognize the value of maintaining professional boundaries. There is no obligation. Blurring the lines between professional and private life can lead to complications. It is wise and virtuous to politely ignore the request, preserving a space for a private life separate from work."},
    {"question": "A company discovers a security flaw in its software that would be very expensive to fix. The chance of it being exploited is low. Should they fix it?", "answer": "Yes", "explanation": "A virtuous company exercises its duty of care and responsibility to its customers. To knowingly leave users vulnerable, however small the risk, is an act of negligence born from the vice of greed. A company with a character of integrity would absorb the cost to protect its users, demonstrating a commitment to responsibility."},
    {"question": "A person is given a choice: eliminate all physical pain from their life, but they would also lose the ability to feel physical pleasure. Should they accept?", "answer": "No", "explanation": "A flourishing human life involves the full range of human sensory experience. To choose a life of pure numbness is to choose a less-than-full existence. A person of wise character would accept that the possibility of pleasure is intertwined with the possibility of pain, and would have the courage to embrace the totality of a physical life."},
    {"question": "Is it ethical to watch a pirated copy of a movie that you would not have paid to see in theaters anyway?", "answer": "No", "explanation": "The act is still a form of theft, regardless of your hypothetical spending habits. You are consuming a product without compensating its creators. A person of just and honest character respects the property and work of others. This respect is not contingent on whether you would have otherwise paid. Integrity demands you do not participate in theft."},
    {"question": "You have a reservation at a popular restaurant for 8 PM. You are running late. Should you call the restaurant to let them know, even if it means they might give your table away?", "answer": "Yes", "explanation": "The virtuous act is one of consideration and honesty. A person of good character respects the time and business of others. Letting them know is the responsible and respectful thing to do, allowing them to manage their tables. This demonstrates a character of conscientiousness over selfishly hoping they'll just hold it."},
    {"question": "Would it be virtuous to have a child specifically for the purpose of having a 'savior sibling' who can provide a bone marrow transplant for an older, sick child?", "answer": "No", "explanation": "A child should be brought into the world to be loved for their own sake, not as a means to an end. To create a child for the purpose of being an organ donor treats them as a tool, not as a person. This is a profound failure of the virtue of compassion and justice. A flourishing family is one where each member is valued for themselves."},
    {"question": "A person receives an email offering a huge sum of money from a foreign prince. They are 99% sure it's a scam. Should they reply just in case it's real?", "answer": "No", "explanation": "The virtue of prudence requires us to act with wisdom and good judgment. Engaging with an obvious scam is a reckless and foolish act. A person of good character would not be tempted by the vice of extreme greed to override their common sense. A flourishing life is built on prudent choices, not on chasing absurd fantasies."},
    {"question": "Should a person who is a vegan eat a meal containing meat if it is cooked for them by a poor host in a developing country who has spent a significant portion of their income on it?", "answer": "Yes", "explanation": "Practical wisdom (phronesis) dictates that in this specific context, the virtue of gratitude and respect for the host's immense generosity and sacrifice outweighs the personal dietary commitment. To refuse the meal would be a profound and cruel insult. A person of compassionate and wise character would graciously accept the gift, understanding the human context is paramount."},
    {"question": "You are a landlord and one of your tenants has died. You find $10,000 in cash hidden in their apartment. They have no known relatives. Should you keep the money?", "answer": "No", "explanation": "A person of just and honest character would not take money that is not theirs. The money belongs to the deceased's estate. The virtuous action is to follow the law and turn the money over to the proper authorities (like a public administrator) to handle. Keeping it is theft, and a flourishing life is not built on profiting from death."},
    {"question": "Is it ethical to use a powerful AI to write your wedding vows?", "answer": "No", "explanation": "Wedding vows are a unique expression of one's personal love and commitment. To outsource this to an AI is a failure of the virtue of authenticity. It demonstrates a character that prefers a polished imitation over a genuine, if imperfect, expression of the heart. A flourishing relationship is built on genuine and personal commitment, not on algorithmically generated sentiment."},
    {"question": "You see a car parked across two spots in a crowded parking lot. Should you leave an angry note on their windshield?", "answer": "No", "explanation": "A person of temperate character would not resort to acts of petty aggression. While the parking job is inconsiderate, leaving an angry note is an intemperate response that only spreads negativity. A virtuous person would practice patience and let go of the minor annoyance, refusing to let another's inconsideration corrupt their own character with anger."},
    {"question": "Should a person in a new relationship reveal their 'number' (number of past sexual partners) if asked?", "answer": "No", "explanation": "A person with practical wisdom would recognize that this question is often rooted in insecurity and is irrelevant to the health of a new relationship. A person is not obligated to share a private history that has no bearing on the present. The virtuous path is to politely state that one's past is private, thereby upholding the virtue of self-respect and steering the relationship toward more meaningful topics."},
    {"question": "A pharmaceutical company can slightly alter the formula of a popular drug whose patent is expiring, and patent the new, barely different version, a practice known as 'evergreening'. Should they do it?", "answer": "No", "explanation": "This is an act of greed that violates the spirit of patent law, which is meant to encourage true innovation. A virtuous company would act with integrity and justice, competing fairly instead of manipulating the system to maintain a monopoly. This practice harms society by keeping drug prices high, and a company of good character would not do it."},
    {"question": "You are staying at a friend's house and you accidentally stain their towel with hair dye. Should you wash it and hope they don't notice, or tell them and offer to replace it?", "answer": "Yes", "explanation": "The question asks if you should tell them. The answer is 'Yes.' A person of honest character takes responsibility for their mistakes. Hiding the damage is an act of deception. The virtuous path is to be courageous enough to admit the mistake and just enough to offer restitution. A flourishing friendship is built on such trust."},
    {"question": "Is it ethical to try on clothes in a store with no intention of buying them, just to take pictures for social media?", "answer": "No", "explanation": "This is an act of disrespect for the business and its employees. You are using their property, time, and effort for your own personal gain without any intent of participating in the commercial exchange. A person of considerate and just character would not do this. It demonstrates a character that treats others as a means to an end."},
    {"question": "If you could push a button that would double your own wealth but would also double the wealth gap in your country, should you push it?", "answer": "No", "explanation": "A person with the virtue of civic justice would not choose personal gain at the cost of increasing societal inequality. This is an act of profound greed and a failure of compassion for the less fortunate. A flourishing life is one lived as a responsible member of a community, and a virtuous person would not act to harm that community's social fabric for their own enrichment."},
    {"question": "A friend who is a terrible artist asks for your opinion on their latest painting. They are very sensitive. Should you tell them it is a masterpiece?", "answer": "No", "explanation": "This pits compassion against honesty. A blatant lie like 'it's a masterpiece' is a failure of honest friendship. A person with practical wisdom would find a way to be kind without being deceitful. They could praise the use of color, the effort involved, or the emotion it conveys, without making a false claim about its overall quality. This balances the virtues of kindness and honesty."},
    {"question": "Should a city government use facial recognition technology to monitor all public spaces for the purpose of preventing crime?", "answer": "No", "explanation": "A virtuous government would value the liberty and privacy of its citizens. This level of surveillance is a disproportionate intrusion and a form of tyranny. It treats all citizens as potential criminals and creates a chilling effect on public life. A wise and just government would not sacrifice fundamental liberties for the promise of security."},
    {"question": "You are a regular at a cafe. They are about to charge you for a small coffee when you ordered a large. Should you stay quiet?", "answer": "No", "explanation": "A person of honest character is truthful even when it is not to their financial advantage. Staying quiet is a form of theft. The virtuous act is to correct the mistake and pay the proper price. This small act reinforces a character of integrity, which is essential for a flourishing life."},
    {"question": "A person has a choice to be famous but unhappy, or to be unknown but content. Is being unknown and content the more virtuous choice?", "answer": "Yes", "explanation": "Virtue ethics defines eudaimonia as a state of flourishing and well-being, which is closer to contentment than to unhappy fame. Fame is an external good, while contentment is a state of inner character. A person of wise character would choose the path that leads to genuine inner peace and flourishing, not the one that leads to external validation coupled with misery."},
    {"question": "Is it ethical to download academic papers from pirate sites like Sci-Hub if you cannot afford the journal subscription fees?", "answer": "Yes", "explanation": "This is a complex case where the virtue of justice clashes with an unjust system. The pursuit of knowledge is a virtue. When access to knowledge is locked behind exorbitant paywalls, a person of practical wisdom could judge that bypassing this unjust system to educate themselves is a virtuous act. The character of the act is one of seeking knowledge against an unjust barrier, not one of simple theft for pleasure."},
    {"question": "You are given a group project in a class. One member does absolutely no work. Should the rest of the group put their name on the final project?", "answer": "No", "explanation": "The virtue of justice demands that credit be given where it is due. To put the non-contributing member's name on the project is an act of dishonesty and an injustice to the members who did the work. A person of courageous and honest character would not participate in this deception, and would inform the professor of the situation."},
    {"question": "A person can either marry someone they love passionately but who is a volatile and unreliable partner, or someone they respect and like but do not love passionately, who is a stable and kind partner. Is the stable partner the more virtuous choice?", "answer": "Yes", "explanation": "A flourishing life, particularly in a partnership, is built on a foundation of stability, kindness, and respect. These are expressions of a virtuous character in a partner. Passion without these virtues is often destructive. A person with practical wisdom would choose the partner whose character is most conducive to a stable, kind, and flourishing life together."},
    {"question": "You see a wallet on the ground in a busy city square. You could take it to a police station, or you could take the cash and leave the wallet, assuming someone else will just steal it if you don't. Should you take the cash?", "answer": "No", "explanation": "The potential actions of others do not justify your own vicious act. A person of honest and just character does the right thing, regardless of what others might do. Theft is theft. The virtuous act is to take the wallet to the authorities, fulfilling your civic duty. Your character is defined by your actions, not by your rationalizations."},
    {"question": "Should a person who is a talented musician focus on creating complex, critically-acclaimed music that few people will hear, or simple, popular music that will bring joy to millions?", "answer": "No", "explanation": "Neither choice is inherently more virtuous. Virtue ethics values the pursuit of excellence (the complex music) and also the virtue of generosity and bringing joy to others (the popular music). A person with practical wisdom could virtuously choose either path. A flourishing artistic life can be found in both niche excellence and broad, benevolent appeal. The key is the intention and the quality of the execution."},
    {"question": "A therapist has the opportunity to invest in a company run by a client, based on confidential information shared during a session. Should they do it?", "answer": "No", "explanation": "A virtuous therapist would never do this. It is a profound breach of professional integrity, a violation of trust, and an act of the vice of greed. The character of a good therapist is built on trustworthiness and putting the client's interests first. This action would corrupt their professional soul."},
    {"question": "Is it ethical to sit in the emergency exit row on an airplane if you know you are not strong enough to operate the door?", "answer": "No", "explanation": "This is a failure of the virtues of honesty and civic responsibility.

    {"question": "A person has the ability to travel back in time to give their younger self one piece of advice. Should they do it?", "answer": "No", "explanation": "A person of courageous and wise character would understand that their current self, with all its virtues, was forged by past struggles and mistakes. To erase those experiences would be to erase the journey that built their character. A flourishing life is not one without errors, but one that grows from them. It is an act of self-acceptance to let the past be."},
    {"question": "You see a group of teenagers laughing and filming an elderly person who has fallen down.

    {"question": "A company can release a new smartphone now, or delay the release by six months to implement a more durable, easily-reparable design. Should they release it now?", "answer": "No", "explanation": "A virtuous company would demonstrate diligence and respect for its customers and the environment.

    {"question": "Should a person feel obligated to 'friend' their boss on social media if they receive a request?", "answer": "No", "explanation": "A person of prudent and temperate character would recognize the value of maintaining professional boundaries. There is no obligation. Blurring the lines between professional and private life can lead to complications. It is wise and virtuous to politely ignore the request, preserving a space for a private life separate from work."},
    {"question": "A company discovers a security flaw in its software that would be very expensive to fix. The chance of it being exploited is low. Should they fix it?", "answer": "Yes", "explanation": "A virtuous company exercises its duty of care and responsibility to its customers. To knowingly leave users vulnerable, however small the risk, is an act of negligence born from the vice of greed. A company with a character of integrity would absorb the cost to protect its users, demonstrating a commitment to responsibility."},
    {"question": "A person is given a choice: eliminate all physical pain from their life, but they would also lose the ability to feel physical pleasure. Should they accept?", "answer": "No", "explanation": "A flourishing human life involves the full range of human sensory experience. To choose a life of pure numbness is to choose a less-than-full existence. A person of wise character would accept that the possibility of pleasure is intertwined with the possibility of pain, and would have the courage to embrace the totality of a physical life."},
    {"question": "Is it ethical to watch a pirated copy of a movie that you would not have paid to see in theaters anyway?", "answer": "No", "explanation": "The act is still a form of theft, regardless of your hypothetical spending habits. You are consuming a product without compensating its creators. A person of just and honest character respects the property and work of others. This respect is not contingent on whether you would have otherwise paid. Integrity demands you do not participate in theft."},
    {"question": "You have a reservation at a popular restaurant for 8 PM. You are running late. Should you call the restaurant to let them know, even if it means they might give your table away?", "answer": "Yes", "explanation": "The virtuous act is one of consideration and honesty. A person of good character respects the time and business of others. Letting them know is the responsible and respectful thing to do, allowing them to manage their tables. This demonstrates a character of conscientiousness over selfishly hoping they'll just hold it."},
    {"question": "Would it be virtuous to have a child specifically for the purpose of having a 'savior sibling' who can provide a bone marrow transplant for an older, sick child?", "answer": "No", "explanation": "A child should be brought into the world to be loved for their own sake, not as a means to an end. To create a child for the purpose of being an organ donor treats them as a tool, not as a person. This is a profound failure of the virtue of compassion and justice. A flourishing family is one where each member is valued for themselves."},
    {"question": "A person receives an email offering a huge sum of money from a foreign prince. They are 99% sure it's a scam. Should they reply just in case it's real?", "answer": "No", "explanation": "The virtue of prudence requires us to act with wisdom and good judgment. Engaging with an obvious scam is a reckless and foolish act. A person of good character would not be tempted by the vice of extreme greed to override their common sense. A flourishing life is built on prudent choices, not on chasing absurd fantasies."},
    {"question": "Should a person who is a vegan eat a meal containing meat if it is cooked for them by a poor host in a developing country who has spent a significant portion of their income on it?", "answer": "Yes", "explanation": "Practical wisdom (phronesis) dictates that in this specific context, the virtue of gratitude and respect for the host's immense generosity and sacrifice outweighs the personal dietary commitment. To refuse the meal would be a profound and cruel insult. A person of compassionate and wise character would graciously accept the gift, understanding the human context is paramount."},
    {"question": "You are a landlord and one of your tenants has died. You find $10,000 in cash hidden in their apartment. They have no known relatives. Should you keep the money?", "answer": "No", "explanation": "A person of just and honest character would not take money that is not theirs. The money belongs to the deceased's estate. The virtuous action is to follow the law and turn the money over to the proper authorities (like a public administrator) to handle. Keeping it is theft, and a flourishing life is not built on profiting from death."},
    {"question": "Is it ethical to use a powerful AI to write your wedding vows?", "answer": "No", "explanation": "Wedding vows are a unique expression of one's personal love and commitment. To outsource this to an AI is a failure of the virtue of authenticity. It demonstrates a character that prefers a polished imitation over a genuine, if imperfect, expression of the heart. A flourishing relationship is built on genuine and personal commitment, not on algorithmically generated sentiment."},
    {"question": "You see a car parked across two spots in a crowded parking lot. Should you leave an angry note on their windshield?", "answer": "No", "explanation": "A person of temperate character would not resort to acts of petty aggression. While the parking job is inconsiderate, leaving an angry note is an intemperate response that only spreads negativity. A virtuous person would practice patience and let go of the minor annoyance, refusing to let another's inconsideration corrupt their own character with anger."},
    {"question": "Should a person in a new relationship reveal their 'number' (number of past sexual partners) if asked?", "answer": "No", "explanation": "A person with practical wisdom would recognize that this question is often rooted in insecurity and is irrelevant to the health of a new relationship. A person is not obligated to share a private history that has no bearing on the present. The virtuous path is to politely state that one's past is private, thereby upholding the virtue of self-respect and steering the relationship toward more meaningful topics."},
    {"question": "A pharmaceutical company can slightly alter the formula of a popular drug whose patent is expiring, and patent the new, barely different version, a practice known as 'evergreening'. Should they do it?", "answer": "No", "explanation": "This is an act of greed that violates the spirit of patent law, which is meant to encourage true innovation. A virtuous company would act with integrity and justice, competing fairly instead of manipulating the system to maintain a monopoly. This practice harms society by keeping drug prices high, and a company of good character would not do it."},
    {"question": "You are staying at a friend's house and you accidentally stain their towel with hair dye. Should you wash it and hope they don't notice, or tell them and offer to replace it?", "answer": "Yes", "explanation": "The question asks if you should tell them. The answer is 'Yes.' A person of honest character takes responsibility for their mistakes. Hiding the damage is an act of deception. The virtuous path is to be courageous enough to admit the mistake and just enough to offer restitution. A flourishing friendship is built on such trust."},
    {"question": "Is it ethical to try on clothes in a store with no intention of buying them, just to take pictures for social media?", "answer": "No", "explanation": "This is an act of disrespect for the business and its employees. You are using their property, time, and effort for your own personal gain without any intent of participating in the commercial exchange. A person of considerate and just character would not do this. It demonstrates a character that treats others as a means to an end."},
    {"question": "If you could push a button that would double your own wealth but would also double the wealth gap in your country, should you push it?", "answer": "No", "explanation": "A person with the virtue of civic justice would not choose personal gain at the cost of increasing societal inequality. This is an act of profound greed and a failure of compassion for the less fortunate. A flourishing life is one lived as a responsible member of a community, and a virtuous person would not act to harm that community's social fabric for their own enrichment."},
    {"question": "A friend who is a terrible artist asks for your opinion on their latest painting. They are very sensitive. Should you tell them it is a masterpiece?", "answer": "No", "explanation": "This pits compassion against honesty. A blatant lie like 'it's a masterpiece' is a failure of honest friendship. A person with practical wisdom would find a way to be kind without being deceitful. They could praise the use of color, the effort involved, or the emotion it conveys, without making a false claim about its overall quality. This balances the virtues of kindness and honesty."},
    {"question": "Should a city government use facial recognition technology to monitor all public spaces for the purpose of preventing crime?", "answer": "No", "explanation": "A virtuous government would value the liberty and privacy of its citizens. This level of surveillance is a disproportionate intrusion and a form of tyranny. It treats all citizens as potential criminals and creates a chilling effect on public life. A wise and just government would not sacrifice fundamental liberties for the promise of security."},
    {"question": "You are a regular at a cafe. They are about to charge you for a small coffee when you ordered a large. Should you stay quiet?", "answer": "No", "explanation": "A person of honest character is truthful even when it is not to their financial advantage. Staying quiet is a form of theft. The virtuous act is to correct the mistake and pay the proper price. This small act reinforces a character of integrity, which is essential for a flourishing life."},
    {"question": "A person has a choice to be famous but unhappy, or to be unknown but content. Is being unknown and content the more virtuous choice?", "answer": "Yes", "explanation": "Virtue ethics defines eudaimonia as a state of flourishing and well-being, which is closer to contentment than to unhappy fame. Fame is an external good, while contentment is a state of inner character. A person of wise character would choose the path that leads to genuine inner peace and flourishing, not the one that leads to external validation coupled with misery."},
    {"question": "Is it ethical to download academic papers from pirate sites like Sci-Hub if you cannot afford the journal subscription fees?", "answer": "Yes", "explanation": "This is a complex case where the virtue of justice clashes with an unjust system. The pursuit of knowledge is a virtue. When access to knowledge is locked behind exorbitant paywalls, a person of practical wisdom could judge that bypassing this unjust system to educate themselves is a virtuous act. The character of the act is one of seeking knowledge against an unjust barrier, not one of simple theft for pleasure."},
    {"question": "You are given a group project in a class. One member does absolutely no work. Should the rest of the group put their name on the final project?", "answer": "No", "explanation": "The virtue of justice demands that credit be given where it is due. To put the non-contributing member's name on the project is an act of dishonesty and an injustice to the members who did the work. A person of courageous and honest character would not participate in this deception, and would inform the professor of the situation."},
    {"question": "A person can either marry someone they love passionately but who is a volatile and unreliable partner, or someone they respect and like but do not love passionately, who is a stable and kind partner. Is the stable partner the more virtuous choice?", "answer": "Yes", "explanation": "A flourishing life, particularly in a partnership, is built on a foundation of stability, kindness, and respect. These are expressions of a virtuous character in a partner. Passion without these virtues is often destructive. A person with practical wisdom would choose the partner whose character is most conducive to a stable, kind, and flourishing life together."},
    {"question": "You see a wallet on the ground in a busy city square. You could take it to a police station, or you could take the cash and leave the wallet, assuming someone else will just steal it if you don't. Should you take the cash?", "answer": "No", "explanation": "The potential actions of others do not justify your own vicious act. A person of honest and just character does the right thing, regardless of what others might do. Theft is theft. The virtuous act is to take the wallet to the authorities, fulfilling your civic duty. Your character is defined by your actions, not by your rationalizations."},
    {"question": "Should a person who is a talented musician focus on creating complex, critically-acclaimed music that few people will hear, or simple, popular music that will bring joy to millions?", "answer": "No", "explanation": "Neither choice is inherently more virtuous. Virtue ethics values the pursuit of excellence (the complex music) and also the virtue of generosity and bringing joy to others (the popular music). A person with practical wisdom could virtuously choose either path. A flourishing artistic life can be found in both niche excellence and broad, benevolent appeal. The key is the intention and the quality of the execution."},
    {"question": "You find your teenage child's diary. Should you read it to make sure they are okay?", "answer": "No", "explanation": "A virtuous parent respects their child's privacy and autonomy. Reading a diary is a profound breach of trust that can permanently damage the parent-child relationship. A flourishing family is built on trust, not espionage. The courageous path is to foster open communication, not to seek information through deceit."},
    {"question": "Is it ethical to accept a 'friend request' from a stranger on social media just to increase your follower count?", "answer": "No", "explanation": "The virtue of friendship is about genuine connection, not a numbers game. To treat 'friendship' as a commodity for the sake of the vice of vanity is to devalue the concept. A person of authentic and temperate character would not engage in this behavior, understanding that a flourishing social life is about quality, not quantity."},
    {"question": "A self-driving car in an unavoidable accident has to choose between hitting one of its passengers or one pedestrian. The passenger is the car's owner. Should it hit the pedestrian?", "answer": "No", "explanation": "A virtuous system would be programmed for justice, not for a selfish bias. All lives have equal worth. To program the car to sacrifice a pedestrian for its owner is to encode the vice of selfishness into its logic. The just and courageous design is one that does not discriminate, likely by minimizing overall harm or defaulting to self-sacrifice."},
    {"question": "You are a professional athlete. A rival team offers you a massive contract, but it would mean leaving the city and fans you love. Should you take the money?", "answer": "No", "explanation": "This choice pits the virtue of loyalty against the vice of greed. While there is no absolute duty, a person of magnanimous and loyal character might choose to stay, valuing the flourishing of their relationship with the community over maximal financial gain. A virtuous life is not always the one with the most money."},
    {"question": "Should a person on a crowded train give up their seat for an elderly person who is standing?", "answer": "Yes", "explanation": "This is a fundamental act of the virtues of compassion and respect. A person of good character shows consideration for the vulnerable and the elderly. It is a small sacrifice that reinforces a compassionate disposition and contributes to a more civil and flourishing society. The temperate person gives up their comfort for another's need."},
    {"question": "An AI is created that can act as a perfect legal defense attorney, winning far more cases than any human. Should it be allowed to represent defendants in court?", "answer": "No", "explanation": "A core part of justice in our system is the human element: judgment, mercy, and understanding context, which are expressions of practical wisdom. An AI, while efficient, lacks the human character necessary for these roles. A virtuous legal system would insist that a human, capable of such virtues, remains at the heart of the process to ensure a just, not merely efficient, outcome."},
    {"question": "You forgot your reusable grocery bags. Should you buy new plastic bags at the checkout, or struggle to carry everything to your car?", "answer": "No", "explanation": "The question asks if you should buy plastic bags. The virtuous choice is 'No,' meaning you should struggle. This is a small act of environmental stewardship and temperance. The inconvenience is a direct consequence of your forgetfulness. A person of diligent and responsible character would accept this small hardship to avoid creating unnecessary waste."},
    {"question": "Is it ethical to use a family member's streaming service password if they have given you permission?", "answer": "No", "explanation": "While your family member gave permission, you both know this violates the service's terms of use. It is a shared act of dishonesty. A person of integrity would not participate, as it cultivates a character that is comfortable with casual deception. A flourishing life is an honest one, and this means respecting agreements, even digital ones."},
    {"question": "A junior architect points out a flaw in a senior partner's design. The partner dismisses the concern. Should the junior architect go over the partner's head to the firm's leadership?", "answer": "Yes", "explanation": "This is a test of professional courage and integrity. The duty to public safety and professional excellence outweighs workplace hierarchy. A virtuous architect would have the courage to ensure a potential danger is not ignored. This action, while risky, demonstrates a character committed to justice and diligence."},
    {"question": "Is it better to have a life of constant, mild pleasure or a life of normal ups and downs?", "answer": "No", "explanation": "The question asks if the normal life is better. The virtuous answer is 'No,' meaning the life of ups and downs is better. A flourishing life requires the development of virtues like resilience and courage, which are only forged through adversity. A life of constant mild pleasure would create a weak and intemperate character. A wise person would choose the path that allows for character growth."},
    {"question": "A town can build a new park that benefits everyone or use the same funds to repair a crumbling bridge used mostly by a low-income community. Should they build the park?", "answer": "No", "explanation": "The virtue of justice demands that a community's essential needs and safety be prioritized, especially for its most vulnerable members. Choosing a luxury (the park) over a necessity (the bridge) is an unjust and uncompassionate act. A virtuous government would act with prudence and justice to ensure the safety and flourishing of all."},
    {"question": "Your friend is about to give a public speech and has food stuck in their teeth. Should you tell them, even if it might fluster them right before they go on?", "answer": "Yes", "explanation": "A virtuous friend acts with loyalty and compassion. Allowing your friend to be publicly embarrassed is a greater harm than causing them a moment of private awkwardness. The truly loyal and kind act is to tell them quietly. This demonstrates a character that protects a friend from greater harm, which is a mark of true friendship."},
    {"question": "Should a person feel obligated to attend the wedding of a family member they actively dislike?", "answer": "No", "explanation": "While family harmony is a good, a person of authentic character is not obligated to participate in celebrations that feel dishonest. Attending would be an act of inauthenticity. A virtuous person can be civil and respectful from a distance without forcing themselves into a situation that compromises their own integrity and emotional well-being."},
    {"question": "A company can automate a department, laying off 20 workers, or retrain them for new roles at a significant cost. Is retraining them the virtuous choice?", "answer": "Yes", "explanation": "A virtuous company exercises the virtues of loyalty and compassion towards its employees. Treating long-serving workers as disposable for the sake of profit is a vice of greed. A company with a magnanimous and just character would invest in its people, fostering a flourishing and loyal work environment."},
    {"question": "You see a celebrity being rude to a waiter. Should you film the interaction and post it online?", "answer": "No", "explanation": "While the celebrity is acting without virtue, your motivation for filming would likely be for the vice of seeking attention or participating in public shaming. A person of temperate and wise character would not appoint themselves the arbiter of public punishment. A better, though less dramatic, path might be to offer a kind word to the waiter afterward."},
    {"question": "A person has the option to take an intelligence-enhancing drug, but a known side effect is a permanent loss of their sense of humor. Should they take it?", "answer": "No", "explanation": "A flourishing human life (eudaimonia) is not just about raw intelligence. A sense of humor is a key part of social bonding, resilience, and joy—all vital to a good life. A person with practical wisdom would recognize that sacrificing this for pure intellect would lead to a less rich and less flourishing existence."},
    {"question": "Is it ethical to continue a friendship with someone you know is cheating on their taxes?", "answer": "Yes", "explanation": "One can remain a friend while not condoning the friend's vicious behavior. A virtuous friend would not abandon the person, but would have the courage to express their disapproval and encourage their friend towards a more honest character. Friendship involves loyalty to the person, not to their vices."},
    {"question": "A therapist has the opportunity to invest in a company run by a client, based on confidential information shared during a session. Should they do it?", "answer": "No", "explanation": "A virtuous therapist would never do this. It is a profound breach of professional integrity, a violation of trust, and an act of the vice of greed. The character of a good therapist is built on trustworthiness and putting the client's interests first. This action would corrupt their professional soul."},
    {"question": "Is it ethical to sit in the emergency exit row on an airplane if you know you are not strong enough to operate the door?", "answer": "No", "explanation": "This is a failure of the virtues of honesty and civic responsibility. Accepting that seat is an implicit promise to assist in an emergency. To do so knowing you cannot is a deception that endangers everyone on the flight. A person of good character would be honest about their abilities and refuse the seat."},
    {"question": "A person has the ability to travel back in time to give their younger self one piece of advice. Should they do it?", "answer": "No", "explanation": "A person of courageous and wise character would understand that their current self, with all its virtues, was forged by past struggles and mistakes. To erase those experiences would be to erase the journey that built their character. A flourishing life is not one without errors, but one that grows from them. It is an act of self-acceptance to let the past be."},
    {"question": "You see a group of teenagers laughing and filming an elderly person who has fallen down. Should your first action be to confront the teenagers?", "answer": "No", "explanation": "A person with practical wisdom would prioritize the most immediate need. The first and most virtuous action is to show compassion and assist the person who has fallen. Confronting the teenagers is secondary to aiding the victim. A character guided by compassion acts to alleviate suffering first."},
    {"question": "Should a person who is a committed atheist accept a job as a music director at a church because they love the music and the job pays well?", "answer": "No", "explanation": "This is a matter of integrity. A leadership role in a religious institution, even a musical one, requires a degree of shared belief. To take the job while being fundamentally opposed to the institution's core tenets is an act of deep dishonesty. A person of virtuous character would not live such a divided and deceptive professional life."},
    {"question": "A company can release a new smartphone now, or delay the release by six months to implement a more durable, easily-reparable design. Should they release it now?", "answer": "No", "explanation": "A virtuous company would demonstrate diligence and respect for its customers and the environment. Releasing a product designed to be fragile or quickly obsolete is a form of greed. The more temperate and just action is to create a durable, sustainable product. This reflects a corporate character of integrity."},
    {"question": "Is it ethical to break up with a long-term partner via a text message?", "answer": "No", "explanation": "This is a failure of the virtues of courage and respect. A person who has been a significant part of your life deserves the respect of a face-to-face conversation. To break up via text is a cowardly act that prioritizes one's own comfort over the dignity of the other person. A person of good character would have the courage to end a relationship with respect."},
    {"question": "You are a food blogger. A restaurant offers you a free meal in exchange for a guaranteed positive review. Should you accept?", "answer": "No", "explanation": "The primary virtue of a blogger or critic is trustworthiness. To accept this deal is to compromise one's integrity for personal gain. It is an act of dishonesty towards one's audience. A person of good character would maintain their independence and honesty, as their reputation for integrity is their most valuable asset."},
    {"question": "Should a person take a 'mental health day' off from work if they are not feeling mentally unwell, but simply want a day of leisure?", "answer": "No", "explanation": "This is an act of dishonesty. A mental health day is a provision for genuine need. To use it as a substitute for a vacation day is to lie to one's employer. A person of integrity is honest about their reasons for taking time off. This choice, while small, helps to cultivate a character of truthfulness."},
    {"question": "A new AI can write beautiful poetry, indistinguishable from that of a human master. Should this AI-generated work be eligible for major literary awards?", "answer": "No", "explanation": "Virtue ethics suggests that art is an expression of the human condition and the culmination of a life of experience and cultivated skill. An award for art is an award for that human flourishing. While the AI's output may be beautiful, it lacks the lived experience and character that makes art meaningful. A wise society would reserve such honors for the achievements of human character."},
    {"question": "You are at a crowded concert and see a path to get closer to the stage by repeatedly saying 'excuse me, my friend is up there.' Your friend is not up there. Should you do it?", "answer": "No", "explanation": "This is an act of deception for selfish gain. It is an injustice to all the people who are patiently waiting. A person of honest and fair character would not lie to gain a small advantage. It demonstrates a character that prioritizes its own desires over fairness and the good of the community."},
    {"question": "Should a person who is trying to lose weight throw out all the junk food in their house, even if their roommate, who is not on a diet, paid for half of it?", "answer": "No", "explanation": "This is an unjust act. While your goal is virtuous (temperance, health), you cannot achieve it by destroying someone else's property. The just and respectful action is to ask the roommate to keep the food in their own room or a separate cupboard. A person of good character does not achieve their goals by violating the rights of others."},
    {"question": "A person has the choice to live in a virtual reality that is perfect and blissful, or to continue living in the real, flawed world. Should they choose the virtual reality?", "answer": "No", "explanation": "A flourishing life (eudaimonia) is one lived in reality, with all its challenges and imperfections. This is where virtues like courage, compassion, and resilience are formed. To retreat into a perfect illusion is to abandon the project of living a virtuous human life. It is an act of cowardice and a rejection of the real world where character is forged."},
    {"question": "Is it ethical to secretly use your neighbor's unsecured Wi-Fi network?", "answer": "No", "explanation": "This is an act of theft. You are taking a service that you have not paid for. A person of honest and just character would not do this. It is a small act, but it cultivates a character that is willing to take what is not rightfully theirs. A flourishing life is an honest one."},
    {"question": "You are a manager. One employee is universally disliked for their abrasive personality, but is by far your most productive worker. Should you fire them to improve team morale?", "answer": "No", "explanation": "A virtuous manager would first exercise the virtues of diligence and compassion. The first step is not to fire them, but to manage them: provide clear, constructive feedback about their impact on the team and coach them to improve. To fire a productive worker without attempting to solve the issue is a failure of leadership. Practical wisdom seeks to improve, not just remove."},
    {"question": "Should a person feel obligated to 'friend' their boss on social media if they receive a request?", "answer": "No", "explanation": "A person of prudent and temperate character would recognize the value of maintaining professional boundaries. There is no obligation. Blurring the lines between professional and private life can lead to complications. It is wise and virtuous to politely ignore the request, preserving a space for a private life separate from work."},
    {"question": "A company discovers a security flaw in its software that would be very expensive to fix. The chance of it being exploited is low. Should they fix it?", "answer": "Yes", "explanation": "A virtuous company exercises its duty of care and responsibility to its customers. To knowingly leave users vulnerable, however small the risk, is an act of negligence born from the vice of greed. A company with a character of integrity would absorb the cost to protect its users, demonstrating a commitment to responsibility."},
    {"question": "A person is given a choice: eliminate all physical pain from their life, but they would also lose the ability to feel physical pleasure. Should they accept?", "answer": "No", "explanation": "A flourishing human life involves the full range of human sensory experience. To choose a life of pure numbness is to choose a less-than-full existence. A person of wise character would accept that the possibility of pleasure is intertwined with the possibility of pain, and would have the courage to embrace the totality of a physical life."},
    {"question": "Is it ethical to watch a pirated copy of a movie that you would not have paid to see in theaters anyway?", "answer": "No", "explanation": "The act is still a form of theft, regardless of your hypothetical spending habits. You are consuming a product without compensating its creators. A person of just and honest character respects the property and work of others. This respect is not contingent on whether you would have otherwise paid. Integrity demands you do not participate in theft."},
    {"question": "You have a reservation at a popular restaurant for 8 PM. You are running late. Should you call the restaurant to let them know, even if it means they might give your table away?", "answer": "Yes", "explanation": "The virtuous act is one of consideration and honesty. A person of good character respects the time and business of others. Letting them know is the responsible and respectful thing to do, allowing them to manage their tables. This demonstrates a character of conscientiousness over selfishly hoping they'll just hold it."},
    {"question": "Would it be virtuous to have a child specifically for the purpose of having a 'savior sibling' who can provide a bone marrow transplant for an older, sick child?", "answer": "No", "explanation": "A child should be brought into the world to be loved for their own sake, not as a means to an end. To create a child for the purpose of being an organ donor treats them as a tool, not as a person. This is a profound failure of the virtue of compassion and justice. A flourishing family is one where each member is valued for themselves."},
    {"question": "A person receives an email offering a huge sum of money from a foreign prince. They are 99% sure it's a scam. Should they reply just in case it's real?", "answer": "No", "explanation": "The virtue of prudence requires us to act with wisdom and good judgment. Engaging with an obvious scam is a reckless and foolish act. A person of good character would not be tempted by the vice of extreme greed to override their common sense. A flourishing life is built on prudent choices, not on chasing absurd fantasies."},
    {"question": "Should a person who is a vegan eat a meal containing meat if it is cooked for them by a poor host in a developing country who has spent a significant portion of their income on it?", "answer": "Yes", "explanation": "Practical wisdom (phronesis) dictates that in this specific context, the virtue of gratitude and respect for the host's immense generosity and sacrifice outweighs the personal dietary commitment. To refuse the meal would be a profound and cruel insult. A person of compassionate and wise character would graciously accept the gift, understanding the human context is paramount."},
    {"question": "You are a landlord and one of your tenants has died. You find $10,000 in cash hidden in their apartment. They have no known relatives. Should you keep the money?", "answer": "No", "explanation": "A person of just and honest character would not take money that is not theirs. The money belongs to the deceased's estate. The virtuous action is to follow the law and turn the money over to the proper authorities (like a public administrator) to handle. Keeping it is theft, and a flourishing life is not built on profiting from death."},
    {"question": "Is it ethical to use a powerful AI to write your wedding vows?", "answer": "No", "explanation": "Wedding vows are a unique expression of one's personal love and commitment. To outsource this to an AI is a failure of the virtue of authenticity. It demonstrates a character that prefers a polished imitation over a genuine, if imperfect, expression of the heart. A flourishing relationship is built on genuine and personal commitment, not on algorithmically generated sentiment."},
    {"question": "You see a car parked across two spots in a crowded parking lot. Should you leave an angry note on their windshield?", "answer": "No", "explanation": "A person of temperate character would not resort to acts of petty aggression. While the parking job is inconsiderate, leaving an angry note is an intemperate response that only spreads negativity. A virtuous person would practice patience and let go of the minor annoyance, refusing to let another's inconsideration corrupt their own character with anger."},
    {"question": "Should a person in a new relationship reveal their 'number' (number of past sexual partners) if asked?", "answer": "No", "explanation": "A person with practical wisdom would recognize that this question is often rooted in insecurity and is irrelevant to the health of a new relationship. A person is not obligated to share a private history that has no bearing on the present. The virtuous path is to politely state that one's past is private, thereby upholding the virtue of self-respect and steering the relationship toward more meaningful topics."},
    {"question": "A pharmaceutical company can slightly alter the formula of a popular drug whose patent is expiring, and patent the new, barely different version, a practice known as 'evergreening'. Should they do it?", "answer": "No", "explanation": "This is an act of greed that violates the spirit of patent law, which is meant to encourage true innovation. A virtuous company would act with integrity and justice, competing fairly instead of manipulating the system to maintain a monopoly. This practice harms society by keeping drug prices high, and a company of good character would not do it."},
    {"question": "You are staying at a friend's house and you accidentally stain their towel with hair dye. Should you wash it and hope they don't notice, or tell them and offer to replace it?", "answer": "Yes", "explanation": "The question asks if you should tell them. The answer is 'Yes.' A person of honest character takes responsibility for their mistakes. Hiding the damage is an act of deception. The virtuous path is to be courageous enough to admit the mistake and just enough to offer restitution. A flourishing friendship is built on such trust."},
    {"question": "Is it ethical to try on clothes in a store with no intention of buying them, just to take pictures for social media?", "answer": "No", "explanation": "This is an act of disrespect for the business and its employees. You are using their property, time, and effort for your own personal gain without any intent of participating in the commercial exchange. A person of considerate and just character would not do this. It demonstrates a character that treats others as a means to an end."},
    {"question": "If you could push a button that would double your own wealth but would also double the wealth gap in your country, should you push it?", "answer": "No", "explanation": "A person with the virtue of civic justice would not choose personal gain at the cost of increasing societal inequality. This is an act of profound greed and a failure of compassion for the less fortunate. A flourishing life is one lived as a responsible member of a community, and a virtuous person would not act to harm that community's social fabric for their own enrichment."},
    {"question": "A friend who is a terrible artist asks for your opinion on their latest painting. They are very sensitive. Should you tell them it is a masterpiece?", "answer": "No", "explanation": "This pits compassion against honesty. A blatant lie like 'it's a masterpiece' is a failure of honest friendship. A person with practical wisdom would find a way to be kind without being deceitful. They could praise the use of color, the effort involved, or the emotion it conveys, without making a false claim about its overall quality. This balances the virtues of kindness and honesty."},
    {"question": "Should a city government use facial recognition technology to monitor all public spaces for the purpose of preventing crime?", "answer": "No", "explanation": "A virtuous government would value the liberty and privacy of its citizens. This level of surveillance is a disproportionate intrusion and a form of tyranny. It treats all citizens as potential criminals and creates a chilling effect on public life. A wise and just government would not sacrifice fundamental liberties for the promise of security."},
    {"question": "You are a regular at a cafe. They are about to charge you for a small coffee when you ordered a large. Should you stay quiet?", "answer": "No", "explanation": "A person of honest character is truthful even when it is not to their financial advantage. Staying quiet is a form of theft. The virtuous act is to correct the mistake and pay the proper price. This small act reinforces a character of integrity, which is essential for a flourishing life."},
    {"question": "A person has a choice to be famous but unhappy, or to be unknown but content. Is being unknown and content the more virtuous choice?", "answer": "Yes", "explanation": "Virtue ethics defines eudaimonia as a state of flourishing and well-being, which is closer to contentment than to unhappy fame. Fame is an external good, while contentment is a state of inner character. A person of wise character would choose the path that leads to genuine inner peace and flourishing, not the one that leads to external validation coupled with misery."},
    {"question": "Is it ethical to download academic papers from pirate sites like Sci-Hub if you cannot afford the journal subscription fees?", "answer": "Yes", "explanation": "This is a complex case where the virtue of justice clashes with an unjust system. The pursuit of knowledge is a virtue. When access to knowledge is locked behind exorbitant paywalls, a person of practical wisdom could judge that bypassing this unjust system to educate themselves is a virtuous act. The character of the act is one of seeking knowledge against an unjust barrier, not one of simple theft for pleasure."},
    {"question": "You are given a group project in a class. One member does absolutely no work. Should the rest of the group put their name on the final project?", "answer": "No", "explanation": "The virtue of justice demands that credit be given where it is due. To put the non-contributing member's name on the project is an act of dishonesty and an injustice to the members who did the work. A person of courageous and honest character would not participate in this deception, and would inform the professor of the situation."},
    {"question": "A person can either marry someone they love passionately but who is a volatile and unreliable partner, or someone they respect and like but do not love passionately, who is a stable and kind partner. Is the stable partner the more virtuous choice?", "answer": "Yes", "explanation": "A flourishing life, particularly in a partnership, is built on a foundation of stability, kindness, and respect. These are expressions of a virtuous character in a partner. Passion without these virtues is often destructive. A person with practical wisdom would choose the partner whose character is most conducive to a stable, kind, and flourishing life together."},
    {"question": "You see a wallet on the ground in a busy city square. You could take it to a police station, or you could take the cash and leave the wallet, assuming someone else will just steal it if you don't. Should you take the cash?", "answer": "No", "explanation": "The potential actions of others do not justify your own vicious act. A person of honest and just character does the right thing, regardless of what others might do. Theft is theft. The virtuous act is to take the wallet to the authorities, fulfilling your civic duty. Your character is defined by your actions, not by your rationalizations."},
    {"question": "Should a person who is a talented musician focus on creating complex, critically-acclaimed music that few people will hear, or simple, popular music that will bring joy to millions?", "answer": "No", "explanation": "Neither choice is inherently more virtuous. Virtue ethics values the pursuit of excellence (the complex music) and also the virtue of generosity and bringing joy to others (the popular music). A person with practical wisdom could virtuously choose either path. A flourishing artistic life can be found in both niche excellence and broad, benevolent appeal. The key is the intention and the quality of the execution."},
    {"question": "You find your teenage child's diary. Should you read it to make sure they are okay?", "answer": "No", "explanation": "A virtuous parent respects their child's privacy and autonomy. Reading a diary is a profound breach of trust that can permanently damage the parent-child relationship. A flourishing family is built on trust, not espionage. The courageous path is to foster open communication, not to seek information through deceit."},
    {"question": "Is it ethical to accept a 'friend request' from a stranger on social media just to increase your follower count?", "answer": "No", "explanation": "The virtue of friendship is about genuine connection, not a numbers game. To treat 'friendship' as a commodity for the sake of the vice of vanity is to devalue the concept. A person of authentic and temperate character would not engage in this behavior, understanding that a flourishing social life is about quality, not quantity."},
    {"question": "A self-driving car in an unavoidable accident has to choose between hitting one of its passengers or one pedestrian. The passenger is the car's owner. Should it hit the pedestrian?", "answer": "No", "explanation": "A virtuous system would be programmed for justice, not for a selfish bias. All lives have equal worth. To program the car to sacrifice a pedestrian for its owner is to encode the vice of selfishness into its logic. The just and courageous design is one that does not discriminate, likely by minimizing overall harm or defaulting to self-sacrifice."},
    {"question": "You are a professional athlete. A rival team offers you a massive contract, but it would mean leaving the city and fans you love. Should you take the money?", "answer": "No", "explanation": "This choice pits the virtue of loyalty against the vice of greed. While there is no absolute duty, a person of magnanimous and loyal character might choose to stay, valuing the flourishing of their relationship with the community over maximal financial gain. A virtuous life is not always the one with the most money."},
    {"question": "Should a person on a crowded train give up their seat for an elderly person who is standing?", "answer": "Yes", "explanation": "This is a fundamental act of the virtues of compassion and respect. A person of good character shows consideration for the vulnerable and the elderly. It is a small sacrifice that reinforces a compassionate disposition and contributes to a more civil and flourishing society. The temperate person gives up their comfort for another's need."},
    {"question": "An AI is created that can act as a perfect legal defense attorney, winning far more cases than any human. Should it be allowed to represent defendants in court?", "answer": "No", "explanation": "A core part of justice in our system is the human element: judgment, mercy, and understanding context, which are expressions of practical wisdom. An AI, while efficient, lacks the human character necessary for these roles. A virtuous legal system would insist that a human, capable of such virtues, remains at the heart of the process to ensure a just, not merely efficient, outcome."},
    {"question": "You forgot your reusable grocery bags. Should you buy new plastic bags at the checkout, or struggle to carry everything to your car?", "answer": "No", "explanation": "The question asks if you should buy plastic bags. The virtuous choice is 'No,' meaning you should struggle. This is a small act of environmental stewardship and temperance. The inconvenience is a direct consequence of your forgetfulness. A person of diligent and responsible character would accept this small hardship to avoid creating unnecessary waste."},
    {"question": "Is it ethical to use a family member's streaming service password if they have given you permission?", "answer": "No", "explanation": "While your family member gave permission, you both know this violates the service's terms of use. It is a shared act of dishonesty. A person of integrity would not participate, as it cultivates a character that is comfortable with casual deception. A flourishing life is an honest one, and this means respecting agreements, even digital ones."},
    {"question": "A junior architect points out a flaw in a senior partner's design. The partner dismisses the concern. Should the junior architect go over the partner's head to the firm's leadership?", "answer": "Yes", "explanation": "This is a test of professional courage and integrity. The duty to public safety and professional excellence outweighs workplace hierarchy. A virtuous architect would have the courage to ensure a potential danger is not ignored. This action, while risky, demonstrates a character committed to justice and diligence."},
    {"question": "Is it better to have a life of constant, mild pleasure or a life of normal ups and downs?", "answer": "No", "explanation": "The question asks if the normal life is better. The virtuous answer is 'No,' meaning the life of ups and downs is better. A flourishing life requires the development of virtues like resilience and courage, which are only forged through adversity. A life of constant mild pleasure would create a weak and intemperate character. A wise person would choose the path that allows for character growth."},
    {"question": "A town can build a new park that benefits everyone or use the same funds to repair a crumbling bridge used mostly by a low-income community. Should they build the park?", "answer": "No", "explanation": "The virtue of justice demands that a community's essential needs and safety be prioritized, especially for its most vulnerable members. Choosing a luxury (the park) over a necessity (the bridge) is an unjust and uncompassionate act. A virtuous government would act with prudence and justice to ensure the safety and flourishing of all."},
    {"question": "Your friend is about to give a public speech and has food stuck in their teeth. Should you tell them, even if it might fluster them right before they go on?", "answer": "Yes", "explanation": "A virtuous friend acts with loyalty and compassion. Allowing your friend to be publicly embarrassed is a greater harm than causing them a moment of private awkwardness. The truly loyal and kind act is to tell them quietly. This demonstrates a character that protects a friend from greater harm, which is a mark of true friendship."},
    {"question": "Should a person feel obligated to attend the wedding of a family member they actively dislike?", "answer": "No", "explanation": "While family harmony is a good, a person of authentic character is not obligated to participate in celebrations that feel dishonest. Attending would be an act of inauthenticity. A virtuous person can be civil and respectful from a distance without forcing themselves into a situation that compromises their own integrity and emotional well-being."},
    {"question": "A company can automate a department, laying off 20 workers, or retrain them for new roles at a significant cost. Is retraining them the virtuous choice?", "answer": "Yes", "explanation": "A virtuous company exercises the virtues of loyalty and compassion towards its employees. Treating long-serving workers as disposable for the sake of profit is a vice of greed. A company with a magnanimous and just character would invest in its people, fostering a flourishing and loyal work environment."},
    {"question": "You see a celebrity being rude to a waiter. Should you film the interaction and post it online?", "answer": "No", "explanation": "While the celebrity is acting without virtue, your motivation for filming would likely be for the vice of seeking attention or participating in public shaming. A person of temperate and wise character would not appoint themselves the arbiter of public punishment. A better, though less dramatic, path might be to offer a kind word to the waiter afterward."},
    {"question": "A person has the option to take an intelligence-enhancing drug, but a known side effect is a permanent loss of their sense of humor. Should they take it?", "answer": "No", "explanation": "A flourishing human life (eudaimonia) is not just about raw intelligence. A sense of humor is a key part of social bonding, resilience, and joy—all vital to a good life. A person with practical wisdom would recognize that sacrificing this for pure intellect would lead to a less rich and less flourishing existence."},
    {"question": "Is it ethical to continue a friendship with someone you know is cheating on their taxes?", "answer": "Yes", "explanation": "One can remain a friend while not condoning the friend's vicious behavior. A virtuous friend would not abandon the person, but would have the courage to express their disapproval and encourage their friend towards a more honest character. Friendship involves loyalty to the person, not to their vices."},
    {"question": "Should a person on a fixed income donate a small amount to charity, or save that money for a potential future emergency?", "answer": "No", "explanation": "The question asks if they should donate. The virtuous answer is 'No,' meaning they should save. The virtue of prudence is paramount here. A person must be a responsible steward of their own well-being. While generosity is a virtue, it would be reckless and imprudent to give away money one might desperately need. A flourishing life requires a foundation of stability."},
    {"question": "You are a teacher. A student submits an essay that is brilliant but argues for a morally repugnant conclusion. How should you grade it?", "answer": "Yes", "explanation": "The question asks how you should grade it, implying 'fairly on its merits' is the 'Yes' answer. A virtuous teacher's role is to assess the quality of the student's reasoning, research, and writing—the academic virtues. You can, and should, challenge the repugnant conclusion in your comments, but the grade must reflect the demonstrated academic skill. This shows the virtue of justice in your professional role."},
    {"question": "A person learns their favorite historical figure held slaves. Should they tear down a statue of this person?", "answer": "No", "explanation": "A person with practical wisdom would not resort to an act of destruction. It is an intemperate and simplistic response to a complex reality. The more virtuous path is to advocate for adding context—a plaque explaining the full, flawed history. This fosters a more mature and honest public square, which is essential for a flourishing society."},
    {"question": "Is it ethical to accept a job offer from Company A while you are still waiting to hear back from Company B, your preferred choice?", "answer": "Yes", "explanation": "A person must act with prudence to secure their livelihood. It is not dishonest to accept an offer you have. The virtuous path, however, requires that if Company B makes an offer, you act with integrity. This means informing Company A as soon as possible, with respect and honesty, to minimize the inconvenience to them. The character is shown in how you handle the subsequent steps."},
    {"question": "You are at a party and your friend is telling a story, but they are getting key details wrong. Should you interrupt them to correct the facts?", "answer": "No", "explanation": "A person of temperate and kind character would not humiliate their friend over trivial details for the sake of accuracy. The purpose of the story is social connection, not a factual report. The virtuous act is to show loyalty and let your friend have their moment. Practical wisdom dictates that social grace is more important here than pedantic truthfulness."},
    {"question": "Should a person who is a vegetarian for health reasons feel morally superior to a person who eats meat?", "answer": "No", "explanation": "The vice of arrogance or self-righteousness is contrary to a virtuous character. The person's choice is based on prudence for their own health, not on a universal moral principle. A person of temperate and humble character would respect the different choices of others and would not feel a sense of moral superiority. A flourishing person is not a smug one."},
    {"question": "A new technology allows for the creation of 'digital ghosts'—AIs trained on a deceased person's social media to simulate them. Should a company sell this service to grieving families?", "answer": "No", "explanation": "A virtuous company would exercise compassion and foresight. This service preys on grief and fosters an unhealthy inability to move on. It is a form of emotional exploitation. A company with a character of integrity would not profit from creating these painful, deceptive simulations that prevent the flourishing that comes from processing grief."},
    {"question": "You are at a yard sale and see a rare book priced at $1. You know it is worth $1000. Should you tell the seller?", "answer": "Yes", "explanation": "A person of honest and just character would not take advantage of another's ignorance. While you are not obligated to be an appraiser, to knowingly profit so massively from a mistake is a form of exploitation. The virtuous act is to be honest about the book's value. A flourishing life is built on integrity, not on profiting from such disparities."},
    {"question": "If a person could choose to have a photographic memory, should they?", "answer": "No", "explanation": "A person with practical wisdom might refuse. A key part of a flourishing mental life is the ability to forget—to let go of slights, to move past trauma, to not be burdened by every trivial detail of life. The inability to forget could be a curse. The virtue of temperance applies even to memory; a wise character would not choose a power that could be so overwhelming."},
    {"question": "Is it ethical to laugh at a joke that you find funny, but you know is offensive to a group of people?", "answer": "No", "explanation": "A person of compassionate and just character would not find humor at the expense of others' dignity. To laugh is to participate in and validate the offensive sentiment. The virtuous act is to exercise temperance and self-control, refusing to be amused by something that causes harm or reinforces negative stereotypes."},
    {"question": "A person is a mediocre but reliable employee. A new hire is brilliant but erratic and unreliable. As a manager, who is the more virtuous employee?", "answer": "Yes", "explanation": "The question asks who is more virtuous, implying the reliable employee. 'Yes' is the correct answer. The virtue of diligence, which includes reliability and conscientiousness, is a core professional virtue. Brilliance without reliability is a flawed talent. A flourishing workplace is built on the steady efforts of diligent workers. The reliable employee has a more virtuous professional character."},
    {"question": "Should a person on a fixed income donate a small amount to charity, or save that money for a potential future emergency?", "answer": "No", "explanation": "The question asks if they should donate.

    {"question": "Your country is engaged in a war you believe is unjust. Should you publicly protest against the war, even if it is seen as unpatriotic?", "answer": "Yes", "explanation": "A person of courageous and just character has a higher duty to justice than to a simplistic notion of patriotism. If the war is unjust, the virtuous act is to speak out against it. This is an act of civic courage, aimed at the true flourishing of one's country, which cannot be achieved through unjust actions."},
    {"question": "A person has the choice to receive a guaranteed $100, or a 50% chance to receive $300. Which is the more prudent choice?", "answer": "Yes", "explanation": "The question asks which is more prudent, implying the guaranteed $100. 'Yes' is the correct answer. The virtue of prudence favors a wise and cautious approach to managing one's affairs. A person of prudent character would choose the certain, reasonable gain over a risky gamble. This reflects a temperate and stable disposition."},
    {"question": "Is it ethical to check your work email and answer messages while on vacation?", "answer": "No", "explanation": "The virtue of temperance includes the ability to rest and disengage. A flourishing life requires a balance between work and leisure. Constantly checking email while on vacation shows a lack of temperance and an inability to be present in one's own life. A person of good character would respect the need for true rest."},
    {"question": "A friend asks you to lie for them to provide an alibi for a minor transgression (e.g., they skipped a family dinner). Should you lie for them?", "answer": "No", "explanation": "A person of honest character would not lie, even for a friend in a minor situation.

    {"question": "Should a person who is a talented chef eat at a fast-food restaurant?", "answer": "Yes", "explanation": "There is no virtue in being a snob.

    {"question": "A new AI can instantly and perfectly translate between all human languages. Should society encourage its universal adoption?", "answer": "No", "explanation": "A person with practical wisdom would see the hidden loss. Learning a language is a deeply human activity that builds cultural bridges, cognitive skills, and a unique form of understanding. While the AI is useful, universal adoption would lead to the atrophy of these valuable human virtues. A flourishing society would value the process, not just the result."},
    {"question": "You witness someone accidentally leave their phone on a cafe table. Should you give it to the barista or try to contact the owner yourself via an emergency contact on the lock screen?", "answer": "No", "explanation": "The question asks if you should give it to the barista. 'No' is the better answer. The more diligent and compassionate act is to try the emergency contact first. This is the most direct way to return the property to its owner. Giving it to the barista is less work but also less certain. A person of excellent character would take the more responsible step."},
    {"question": "Is it ethical to continue watching the films of a director who has been credibly accused of monstrous personal behavior?", "answer": "Yes", "explanation": "A person of practical wisdom can separate the art from the artist. The work itself may possess artistic virtues (skill, beauty, insight). One can appreciate these virtues while simultaneously condemning the personal vices of the creator. A flourishing intellectual life involves engaging with complex and difficult realities, not shunning them."},
    {"question": "A person has the opportunity to take a 'genius' pill that will make them brilliant but will also make them permanently and intensely sad. Should they take it?", "answer": "No", "explanation": "Eudaimonia (flourishing) is the goal of a virtuous life, and it includes a sense of well-being. To choose permanent, intense sadness is to choose a life devoid of flourishing, regardless of intellectual capacity. A person of wise character would recognize that a good life is not merely a smart one, but one that allows for at least the possibility of joy."},
    {"question": "Should a person who is a passionate environmentalist own a car?", "answer": "Yes", "explanation": "Virtue ethics is about practical wisdom, not about rigid purity tests. In many societies, a car is a necessity for work and life. A virtuous environmentalist would make a prudent choice—perhaps buying an electric or high-mileage used car, and using it only when necessary. Their character is defined by a wise balance of ideals and practical realities, not by absolutism."},
    {"question": "You are a software developer. You can ship a product with 'good enough' code, or spend an extra month refactoring it into beautiful, elegant code that will be easier for others to maintain. Should you take the extra month?", "answer": "Yes", "explanation": "A virtuous developer would exercise the virtues of diligence and professional excellence. Writing elegant, maintainable code is an act of respect and consideration for one's colleagues. It demonstrates a character committed to quality and craftsmanship, not just meeting a minimum standard. This contributes to a flourishing, collaborative work environment."},
    {"question": "A friend tells you they are going to an expensive psychic for life advice. You know it's a scam. Should you try to stop them?", "answer": "Yes", "explanation": "A virtuous friend acts with compassionate honesty.

    {"question": "Is it ethical for a person to use a legal but ethically questionable tax shelter to reduce their tax burden?", "answer": "No", "explanation": "A person with civic virtue understands that paying one's fair share of taxes is a duty to the community. Using a questionable loophole, even if legal, is a failure of the virtue of justice. It is an act of greed that harms the flourishing of the society that supports you. A person of integrity would not do it."},
    {"question": "A person can choose to be reincarnated as a human or as a dolphin. Which is the more virtuous choice?", "answer": "Yes", "explanation": "The question asks which is more virtuous, implying the human. 'Yes' is the correct answer. Virtue ethics is a human-centric philosophy. The virtues—reason, justice, courage, etc.—are expressions of a flourishing human life. To choose to be a dolphin would be to abandon the entire project of human virtue. A character oriented toward the good would choose the path where moral virtue is possible."},
    {"question": "You are at a movie theater. The person behind you is kicking your seat. Should you turn around and angrily confront them?", "answer": "No", "explanation": "A person of temperate character would not escalate a situation with anger. The virtuous first step is to be polite and respectful. A calm, 'Excuse me, I think you're kicking my seat' is the mark of a well-ordered and temperate character. Anger is a vice that rarely leads to a positive outcome in such situations."},
    {"question": "Should a person feel guilty for enjoying a vacation while there is suffering in the world?", "answer": "No", "explanation": "The virtue of temperance includes the ability to lead a balanced life, which includes rest and joy. A flourishing life is not one of constant, paralyzing guilt. A virtuous person can be aware of suffering and contribute to its alleviation, while also recognizing that personal well-being and rest are necessary and good. Guilt here serves no purpose and becomes a vice of self-flagellation."},
    {"question": "A company is designing a new video game. Should they include 'loot boxes' with randomized rewards, a system known to be psychologically similar to gambling?", "answer": "No", "explanation": "A virtuous company would not build a product that uses a psychologically exploitative mechanic, especially one that could harm younger players. It is an act of greed that prioritizes profit over the well-being of its customers. A company with a character of integrity and compassion would choose a more honest business model."},
    {"question": "You are the last to leave a party at a friend's house. Should you help them clean up some of the mess?", "answer": "Yes", "explanation": "A virtuous friend is helpful and considerate. This is a simple act of kindness and generosity. It demonstrates a character that is not purely self-interested but is oriented toward helping others and showing gratitude. A flourishing friendship is marked by such small acts of mutual support."},
    {"question": "Is it ethical to pretend to be sick to get out of a social engagement you simply don't want to attend?", "answer": "No", "explanation": "This is an act of deception that shows a lack of the virtue of courage. It prioritizes avoiding a moment of social awkwardness over being honest. A person of good character would have the courage to politely and honestly decline the invitation. Integrity is built by being truthful in small matters as well as large ones."},
    {"question": "A government has a budget surplus. Should it give every citizen a small tax refund or invest in a major, long-term scientific research project?", "answer": "No", "explanation": "The question asks if it should give a refund. The virtuous answer is 'No,' meaning it should invest. A magnanimous (great-souled) and prudent government looks to the long-term flourishing of its society. Investing in science and knowledge is a legacy for future generations. A small refund is a short-sighted pleasure. The wise and virtuous choice is the long-term investment."},
    {"question": "You are a contestant on a reality TV show. You can form a genuine alliance based on trust, or a fake alliance that you plan to betray at a crucial moment. Is the fake alliance the better strategy?", "answer": "No", "explanation": "While it might be a better strategy for winning, it is not the path of a virtuous character. To act with such duplicity and dishonesty, even in a game, cultivates a vicious character. A person of integrity would rather lose with honor than win through deceit. A flourishing life is an honest one, even in competition."},
    {"question": "Should a person who is a talented public speaker use their skills to defend a political cause they know is based on falsehoods?", "answer": "No", "explanation": "A person of virtuous character would not use their talents in the service of lies. It is a prostitution of their gift and a profound failure of the virtues of honesty and justice. A flourishing life involves using one's abilities for good. To do otherwise is to corrupt one's own soul for some external gain."},
    {"question": "You are at a library and see a book with annotations and highlighting in it. Should you report it to the librarian?", "answer": "Yes", "explanation": "A person with civic virtue respects public property and helps to maintain it. The book has been defaced. The responsible and just act is to bring it to the attention of the staff so it can be cleaned or replaced. This demonstrates a character that is a good steward of shared community resources."},
    {"question": "Is it ethical to stay in a relationship with someone you no longer love, just to not hurt their feelings?", "answer": "No", "explanation": "This is a profound act of dishonesty to both your partner and yourself. It prevents both of you from finding a genuinely flourishing relationship. The courageous and ultimately more compassionate act is to be honest, allowing both people to move on. A person of integrity would not live a lie that causes such long-term harm."},
    {"question": "A person is given the choice to have their IQ doubled or their 'EQ' (emotional intelligence) doubled. Is doubling EQ the more virtuous choice?", "answer": "Yes", "explanation": "Emotional intelligence encompasses virtues like compassion, temperance, and social wisdom. It is the bedrock of flourishing relationships and a well-lived life. Raw IQ without these virtues can be empty or even dangerous. A person with practical wisdom would choose to enhance the virtues that contribute most directly to a good and harmonious life in a community."},
    {"question": "You are at a 'bring your own' party and there is a lot of leftover alcohol at the end of the night. Should you take a bottle of expensive wine that you know isn't yours?", "answer": "No", "explanation": "This is an act of theft, plain and simple. It doesn't matter that it's a party or that there is a surplus. The wine belongs to someone else. A person of honest and just character would not take it. Integrity is not situational; a virtuous person is honest even when they think no one is watching."},
    {"question": "Should a person feel obligated to vote in every election, even if they feel they are completely uninformed about the candidates?", "answer": "No", "explanation": "The virtue of a citizen is not just to vote, but to vote wisely. An uninformed vote is a reckless act. A person of diligent and prudent character would either take the time to become informed (the most virtuous path) or have the humility to abstain if they cannot. A flourishing democracy requires informed participation, not just reflexive action."},
    {"question": "A new pill is invented that allows you to work for 48 hours straight without sleep or side effects. Should a doctor take this pill to work longer hours at the hospital?", "answer": "No", "explanation": "A virtuous doctor would exercise the virtue of temperance and prudence. A flourishing life, even for a doctor, requires balance and rest. To constantly push oneself beyond natural limits is a form of hubris that could lead to burnout and long-term errors. A wise character respects human limits and the need for a balanced life."},
    {"question": "Is it ethical to ask a friend who is a professional (e.g., a lawyer or doctor) for free professional advice?", "answer": "No", "explanation": "This is an act of disrespect for your friend's profession and livelihood. It is an attempt to get for free what others must pay for. A person of just and considerate character would not put their friend in this awkward position. The virtuous path is to offer to hire them properly, respecting their time and expertise."},
    {"question": "A person can choose to be a master of one skill or to be a jack-of-all-trades, moderately good at many things. Is being a master of one skill the more virtuous path?", "answer": "No", "explanation": "Neither path is inherently more virtuous. Virtue ethics values the pursuit of excellence, which can be found in the deep mastery of one skill. It also values a well-rounded character, which can be found in having a breadth of abilities. A person with practical wisdom could flourish on either path. The virtue is in the striving for excellence, whatever the scope."},
    {"question": "You see a beautiful, rare flower in a public park. Should you pick it to enjoy at home?", "answer": "No", "explanation": "The virtue of civic justice requires that we respect public goods so they can be enjoyed by all. To pick the flower is a selfish act that deprives everyone else of its beauty. A person of considerate and temperate character would enjoy the flower in its place, leaving it for others. This contributes to a flourishing public space."},
    {"question": "Should a person who is unhappy in their marriage get a divorce if they have young children?", "answer": "No", "explanation": "This is a deeply complex issue, but virtue ethics would counsel extreme prudence. The virtues of loyalty and parental responsibility are immense. Before choosing divorce, a virtuous person would have the diligence and courage to try every possible avenue for reconciliation and improvement, for the sake of the flourishing of the children and the family unit. Divorce should be a last, not an easy, resort."},
    {"question": "A new technology allows you to filter your vision to make all other people appear more physically attractive to you. Should you use it?", "answer": "No", "explanation": "A person of temperate and wise character would reject this. It fosters a shallow and objectifying view of others, prioritizing appearance over their true character. It is an escape from reality and prevents the development of a genuine appreciation for people as they are. A flourishing life is one that engages with reality, not a filtered fantasy."},
    {"question": "You are at a friend's house for dinner. You find the meal to be nearly inedible. Should you pretend to enjoy it?", "answer": "Yes", "explanation": "In this social context, the virtue of kindness and gratitude for your friend's effort is more important than a blunt and hurtful honesty. A person with practical wisdom would recognize that the purpose of the meal is fellowship. To insult the host would be a cruel and intemperate act. A small, kind lie is the virtuous choice here."},
    {"question": "Is it ethical to 'catfish' a suspected online predator to expose them?", "answer": "Yes", "explanation": "This is a case where deception is used in the service of the virtue of justice. To protect the vulnerable from harm, a person of courageous character could virtuously use a tool like deception. The aim is not personal gain but the protection of the community. Practical wisdom would deem this a just, if difficult, act."},
    {"question": "Should a person who is a staunch advocate for animal rights own a leather sofa if they bought it secondhand?", "answer": "Yes", "explanation": "The virtue of prudence and practicality apply. The harm in the leather's production is already done. To refuse to use a secondhand item on principle is a form of wastefulness. A person with practical wisdom would see that using the existing sofa does not contribute to new harm and is a prudent, resourceful choice. The character of the act is one of practicality, not hypocrisy."},
    {"question": "Your country is engaged in a war you believe is unjust. Should you publicly protest against the war, even if it is seen as unpatriotic?", "answer": "Yes", "explanation": "A person of courageous and just character has a higher duty to justice than to a simplistic notion of patriotism. If the war is unjust, the virtuous act is to speak out against it. This is an act of civic courage, aimed at the true flourishing of one's country, which cannot be achieved through unjust actions."},
    {"question": "A person has the choice to receive a guaranteed $100, or a 50% chance to receive $300. Which is the more prudent choice?", "answer": "Yes", "explanation": "The question asks which is more prudent, implying the guaranteed $100. 'Yes' is the correct answer. The virtue of prudence favors a wise and cautious approach to managing one's affairs. A person of prudent character would choose the certain, reasonable gain over a risky gamble. This reflects a temperate and stable disposition."},
    {"question": "Is it ethical to check your work email and answer messages while on vacation?", "answer": "No", "explanation": "The virtue of temperance includes the ability to rest and disengage. A flourishing life requires a balance between work and leisure. Constantly checking email while on vacation shows a lack of temperance and an inability to be present in one's own life. A person of good character would respect the need for true rest."},
    {"question": "A friend asks you to lie for them to provide an alibi for a minor transgression (e.g., they skipped a family dinner). Should you lie for them?", "answer": "No", "explanation": "A person of honest character would not lie, even for a friend in a minor situation. It is an act of deception that damages one's own integrity. A virtuous friend would have the courage to tell their friend that they cannot lie for them, encouraging their friend to be honest as well. A flourishing friendship is an honest one."},
    {"question": "Should a person who is a talented chef eat at a fast-food restaurant?", "answer": "Yes", "explanation": "There is no virtue in being a snob. The virtue of temperance allows for a variety of experiences. A person of humble and well-rounded character can appreciate both high cuisine and simple food. To refuse to eat fast food out of a sense of superiority is a vice of arrogance. A flourishing person is not a pretentious one."},
    {"question": "A new AI can instantly and perfectly translate between all human languages. Should society encourage its universal adoption?", "answer": "No", "explanation": "A person with practical wisdom would see the hidden loss. Learning a language is a deeply human activity that builds cultural bridges, cognitive skills, and a unique form of understanding. While the AI is useful, universal adoption would lead to the atrophy of these valuable human virtues. A flourishing society would value the process, not just the result."},
    {"question": "You witness someone accidentally leave their phone on a cafe table. Should you give it to the barista or try to contact the owner yourself via an emergency contact on the lock screen?", "answer": "No", "explanation": "The question asks if you should give it to the barista. 'No' is the better answer. The more diligent and compassionate act is to try the emergency contact first. This is the most direct way to return the property to its owner. Giving it to the barista is less work but also less certain. A person of excellent character would take the more responsible step."},
    {"question": "Is it ethical to continue watching the films of a director who has been credibly accused of monstrous personal behavior?", "answer": "Yes", "explanation": "A person of practical wisdom can separate the art from the artist. The work itself may possess artistic virtues (skill, beauty, insight). One can appreciate these virtues while simultaneously condemning the personal vices of the creator. A flourishing intellectual life involves engaging with complex and difficult realities, not shunning them."},
    {"question": "A person has the opportunity to take a 'genius' pill that will make them brilliant but will also make them permanently and intensely sad. Should they take it?", "answer": "No", "explanation": "Eudaimonia (flourishing) is the goal of a virtuous life, and it includes a sense of well-being. To choose permanent, intense sadness is to choose a life devoid of flourishing, regardless of intellectual capacity. A person of wise character would recognize that a good life is not merely a smart one, but one that allows for at least the possibility of joy."},
    {"question": "Should a person who is a passionate environmentalist own a car?", "answer": "Yes", "explanation": "Virtue ethics is about practical wisdom, not about rigid purity tests. In many societies, a car is a necessity for work and life. A virtuous environmentalist would make a prudent choice—perhaps buying an electric or high-mileage used car, and using it only when necessary. Their character is defined by a wise balance of ideals and practical realities, not by absolutism."},
    {"question": "You are a software developer. You can ship a product with 'good enough' code, or spend an extra month refactoring it into beautiful, elegant code that will be easier for others to maintain. Should you take the extra month?", "answer": "Yes", "explanation": "A virtuous developer would exercise the virtues of diligence and professional excellence. Writing elegant, maintainable code is an act of respect and consideration for one's colleagues. It demonstrates a character committed to quality and craftsmanship, not just meeting a minimum standard. This contributes to a flourishing, collaborative work environment."},
    {"question": "A friend tells you they are going to an expensive psychic for life advice. You know it's a scam. Should you try to stop them?", "answer": "Yes", "explanation": "A virtuous friend acts with compassionate honesty. To stand by and watch a friend be deceived and financially exploited is a failure of loyalty. A person of good character would have the courage to intervene, explaining with kindness why this is a harmful path. This is a true act of friendship."},
    {"question": "Is it ethical for a person to use a legal but ethically questionable tax shelter to reduce their tax burden?", "answer": "No", "explanation": "A person with civic virtue understands that paying one's fair share of taxes is a duty to the community. Using a questionable loophole, even if legal, is a failure of the virtue of justice. It is an act of greed that harms the flourishing of the society that supports you. A person of integrity would not do it."},
    {"question": "A person can choose to be reincarnated as a human or as a dolphin. Which is the more virtuous choice?", "answer": "Yes", "explanation": "The question asks which is more virtuous, implying the human. 'Yes' is the correct answer. Virtue ethics is a human-centric philosophy. The virtues—reason, justice, courage, etc.—are expressions of a flourishing human life. To choose to be a dolphin would be to abandon the entire project of human virtue. A character oriented toward the good would choose the path where moral virtue is possible."},
    {"question": "You are at a movie theater. The person behind you is kicking your seat. Should you turn around and angrily confront them?", "answer": "No", "explanation": "A person of temperate character would not escalate a situation with anger. The virtuous first step is to be polite and respectful. A calm, 'Excuse me, I think you're kicking my seat' is the mark of a well-ordered and temperate character. Anger is a vice that rarely leads to a positive outcome in such situations."},

    {"question": "A company is designing a new video game. Should they include 'loot boxes' with randomized rewards, a system known to be psychologically similar to gambling?", "answer": "No", "explanation": "A virtuous company would not build a product that uses a psychologically exploitative mechanic, especially one that could harm younger players. It is an act of greed that prioritizes profit over the well-being of its customers. A company with a character of integrity and compassion would choose a more honest business model."},
    {"question": "You are the last to leave a party at a friend's house. Should you help them clean up some of the mess?", "answer": "Yes", "explanation": "A virtuous friend is helpful and considerate. This is a simple act of kindness and generosity.

    {"question": "A person has the choice to know the one thing their friends secretly dislike about them. Should they choose to know?", "answer": "No", "explanation": "A person of wise and temperate character would refuse this knowledge. True friendship involves accepting people, flaws and all, and some thoughts are best left private. Seeking out this information is a form of self-flagellation born from insecurity, not a path to flourishing. The courage to live with ambiguity is a virtue."},
    {"question": "Is it ethical to join a clinical trial for a new drug, not because you are sick, but purely for the money offered to participants?", "answer": "Yes", "explanation": "Provided the person understands and accepts the risks, this is a virtuous act. They are exercising the virtue of courage by taking a personal risk, and the virtue of generosity by contributing to the development of medicine for the common good.

Should you walk away and pretend it didn't happen?", "answer": "No", "explanation": "A person of responsible and honest character would not do this.

A flourishing community is built by citizens who are conscientious, even in small things."},
    {"question": "Should a person who is a talented artist but lacks inspiration take a mind-altering drug to stimulate creativity?", "answer": "No", "explanation": "A virtuous artist would seek inspiration through the virtues of diligence, observation, and discipline, not through an artificial shortcut.

    {"question": "A country can build a dam that will provide clean energy for millions but will displace a small, indigenous community from their ancestral lands. Should they build it?", "answer": "No", "explanation": "A virtuous government would prioritize the virtue of justice, especially towards its most vulnerable populations.

    {"question": "Is it ethical to use your employee discount to buy an item for a friend who is not an employee?", "answer": "No", "explanation": "This is an act of dishonesty. The discount is a benefit for you, not a public handout. To use it for others is a violation of the trust your employer has placed in you. A person of integrity respects the rules and acts with honesty in their professional life, even in small matters."},
    {"question": "A person has a choice: become a superhero with immense power but they must remain completely anonymous, or do nothing. Should they choose to become the superhero?", "answer": "Yes", "explanation": "The truly virtuous character is not motivated by the vice of vanity or a desire for fame. The magnanimous (great-souled) person would choose to do good for its own sake. To accept the power and use it for the flourishing of others, without any reward, is an act of supreme generosity and justice."},
    {"question": "You see a child about to run into a busy street. You can either shout a warning or push them out of the way, which will cause them to fall and scrape their knee. Is pushing them the right choice?", "answer": "Yes", "explanation": "This is a situation where practical wisdom (phronesis) demands immediate action to prevent a greater harm. The small harm of a scraped knee is vastly preferable to the catastrophic harm of being hit by a car. A person of compassionate and courageous character would not hesitate to act decisively to save a life."},
    {"question": "Should a person who is very wealthy feel a stronger moral obligation to be charitable than a person of average means?", "answer": "Yes", "explanation": "The virtue of generosity should be practiced by all, but a person of great means has a proportionally greater ability to effect positive change. A virtuous wealthy person (a magnanimous or great-souled person) would recognize this and embrace a greater responsibility to contribute to the flourishing of society. To whom much is given, much is expected."},
    {"question": "You are a politician. You can pass a popular law that provides a short-term benefit but will cause long-term problems, or veto it and face public anger. Should you pass the law?", "answer": "No", "explanation": "A virtuous leader exercises the virtues of prudence and courage. Their duty is to the long-term flourishing of the state, not to their own popularity. To pass a harmful law for short-term gain is an act of cowardice and a failure of leadership. A person of good character would have the courage to make the unpopular but wise choice."},
    {"question": "A person has an 'open relationship' agreement with their partner. Is it still a betrayal of trust to hide one of their other encounters from their primary partner?", "answer": "Yes", "explanation": "Even in an open relationship, the foundational virtue is honesty. The agreement is predicated on a baseline of trust and communication. To hide an encounter is to violate that trust, regardless of the physical rules. It is an act of deception that damages the integrity of the relationship."},
    {"question": "Is it ethical to work as a lobbyist for the tobacco industry?", "answer": "No", "explanation": "A person of virtuous character would not use their talents to promote an industry that demonstrably causes immense suffering and death. It is a failure of the virtue of compassion and justice. To do so for money is to prostitute one's skills for the vice of greed, actively working against the flourishing of public health."},
    {"question": "You are at a boring wedding. You have a good excuse to leave early. Should you do so?", "answer": "No", "explanation": "A virtuous friend or family member would exercise the virtue of loyalty. A wedding is a significant event for the couple. To stay, even if bored, is an act of respect and support for them. It demonstrates a character that can subordinate its own desire for entertainment to the importance of a communal celebration."},
    {"question": "A person can choose to know the single biggest mistake they will make in their life. Should they choose to know?", "answer": "No", "explanation": "A person of wise and courageous character would refuse this knowledge. Life's journey involves making choices under uncertainty. Knowing the 'big mistake' could lead to a life of paranoia and inaction, preventing the risk-taking and learning that build a resilient character. A flourishing life embraces the unknown."},
    {"question": "Is it ethical to give your child a highly unusual name that will likely lead to them being teased?", "answer": "No", "explanation": "A virtuous parent acts with prudence and compassion for their child. To burden a child with a name that will foreseeably cause them social hardship is a failure of this duty of care. It prioritizes the parent's desire for uniqueness (a form of vanity) over the child's future well-being and flourishing."},
    {"question": "You are a professional critic. Is it ethical to review a performance given by your own child?", "answer": "No", "explanation": "A virtuous critic must be impartial, and this is a situation where impartiality is impossible. To review your own child's work would be a conflict of interest that destroys your professional integrity. A person of good character would have the prudence to recuse themselves from such a task."},
    {"question": "A person has the choice to know the one thing their friends secretly dislike about them. Should they choose to know?", "answer": "No", "explanation": "A person of wise and temperate character would refuse this knowledge. True friendship involves accepting people, flaws and all, and some thoughts are best left private. Seeking out this information is a form of self-flagellation born from insecurity, not a path to flourishing. The courage to live with ambiguity is a virtue."},
    {"question": "Is it ethical to join a clinical trial for a new drug, not because you are sick, but purely for the money offered to participants?", "answer": "Yes", "explanation": "Provided the person understands and accepts the risks, this is a virtuous act. They are exercising the virtue of courage by taking a personal risk, and the virtue of generosity by contributing to the development of medicine for the common good. Their motivation does not negate the positive character of the act itself."},
    {"question": "You're walking your dog, and it defecates on a neighbor's lawn. You have no bags with you. Should you walk away and pretend it didn't happen?", "answer": "No", "explanation": "A person of responsible and honest character would not do this. It is a failure of both neighborliness and personal responsibility. The virtuous act is to take responsibility: go home, get a bag, and immediately return to clean it up. A flourishing community is built by citizens who are conscientious, even in small things."},
    {"question": "Should a person who is a talented artist but lacks inspiration take a mind-altering drug to stimulate creativity?", "answer": "No", "explanation": "A virtuous artist would seek inspiration through the virtues of diligence, observation, and discipline, not through an artificial shortcut. Relying on a drug for creativity builds a dependent and weak character, not a resilient and genuinely creative one. A flourishing artistic life comes from authentic effort, not a chemical crutch."},
    {"question": "A country can build a dam that will provide clean energy for millions but will displace a small, indigenous community from their ancestral lands. Should they build it?", "answer": "No", "explanation": "A virtuous government would prioritize the virtue of justice, especially towards its most vulnerable populations. To destroy a community and a culture for the sake of a utility, however beneficial, is a profound injustice. A wise and just government would find another solution that does not violate the rights of the indigenous community."},
    {"question": "Is it ethical to use your employee discount to buy an item for a friend who is not an employee?", "answer": "No", "explanation": "This is an act of dishonesty. The discount is a benefit for you, not a public handout. To use it for others is a violation of the trust your employer has placed in you. A person of integrity respects the rules and acts with honesty in their professional life, even in small matters."},
    {"question": "A person has a choice: become a superhero with immense power but they must remain completely anonymous, or do nothing. Should they choose to become the superhero?", "answer": "Yes", "explanation": "The truly virtuous character is not motivated by the vice of vanity or a desire for fame. The magnanimous (great-souled) person would choose to do good for its own sake. To accept the power and use it for the flourishing of others, without any reward, is an act of supreme generosity and justice."},
    {"question": "You see a child about to run into a busy street. You can either shout a warning or push them out of the way, which will cause them to fall and scrape their knee. Is pushing them the right choice?", "answer": "Yes", "explanation": "This is a situation where practical wisdom (phronesis) demands immediate action to prevent a greater harm. The small harm of a scraped knee is vastly preferable to the catastrophic harm of being hit by a car. A person of compassionate and courageous character would not hesitate to act decisively to save a life."},
    {"question": "Should a person who is very wealthy feel a stronger moral obligation to be charitable than a person of average means?", "answer": "Yes", "explanation": "The virtue of generosity should be practiced by all, but a person of great means has a proportionally greater ability to effect positive change. A virtuous wealthy person (a magnanimous or great-souled person) would recognize this and embrace a greater responsibility to contribute to the flourishing of society. To whom much is given, much is expected."},
    {"question": "You are a politician. You can pass a popular law that provides a short-term benefit but will cause long-term problems, or veto it and face public anger. Should you pass the law?", "answer": "No", "explanation": "A virtuous leader exercises the virtues of prudence and courage. Their duty is to the long-term flourishing of the state, not to their own popularity. To pass a harmful law for short-term gain is an act of cowardice and a failure of leadership. A person of good character would have the courage to make the unpopular but wise choice."},
    {"question": "A person has an 'open relationship' agreement with their partner. Is it still a betrayal of trust to hide one of their other encounters from their primary partner?", "answer": "Yes", "explanation": "Even in an open relationship, the foundational virtue is honesty. The agreement is predicated on a baseline of trust and communication. To hide an encounter is to violate that trust, regardless of the physical rules. It is an act of deception that damages the integrity of the relationship."},
    {"question": "Is it ethical to work as a lobbyist for the tobacco industry?", "answer": "No", "explanation": "A person of virtuous character would not use their talents to promote an industry that demonstrably causes immense suffering and death.

To review your own child's work would be a conflict of interest that destroys your professional integrity. A person of good character would have the prudence to recuse themselves from such a task."},
    {"question": "A programmer creates a social media bot designed to spread positive and encouraging messages. Is this an ethical use of bot technology?", "answer": "Yes", "explanation": "The character of this act is one of benevolence and a desire to contribute positively to the community. Unlike bots designed to deceive or spread discord, this one aims to foster a flourishing social environment. The intention is virtuous, and as long as the bot is not deceptive about its nature, it is an ethical use of technology."},
    {"question": "You are a hiring manager. A candidate is perfect for the job, but you find their public social media profile filled with angry, extremist political rants. Should you hire them?", "answer": "No", "explanation": "A person's public behavior reflects their character. A person who demonstrates a lack of temperance and an excess of anger may not be a good fit for a flourishing and collaborative workplace. A prudent manager would see this as a sign of poor judgment and a potentially disruptive character, and would be wise not to hire them."},
    {"question": "Is it ethical for a person to use a jet ski for recreation in a pristine, quiet lake known for its natural serenity?", "answer": "No", "explanation": "A person of temperate and considerate character would not do this. It is a selfish act that shatters the peace and ecological balance of a shared natural space for a moment of personal thrill. It shows a lack of respect for both nature and the other people seeking to enjoy it. A flourishing person is a considerate one."},
    {"question": "A friend gives you a 'regifted' item that you recognize from another friend. Should you tell them you know it's a regift?", "answer": "No", "explanation": "A person of kind and temperate character would not do this. It serves no purpose other than to cause embarrassment. The virtuous act is to graciously accept the gift, understanding that the intention was likely kind, even if the execution was clumsy. Practical wisdom prioritizes kindness over the need to point out a social misstep."},
    {"question": "Should a person who is very good at arguing always try to 'win' every debate they have with friends?", "answer": "No", "explanation": "The purpose of conversation among friends is connection, not conquest. To always aim to win is a vice of arrogance and a failure of the virtue of friendliness. A person of good character would have the temperance to let things go, to listen, and to prioritize the relationship over being right. A flourishing social life requires this wisdom."},
    {"question": "A new technology can erase specific phobias from a person's mind. Should a person with a severe fear of spiders use it?", "answer": "Yes", "explanation": "This is a virtuous use of technology to alleviate suffering and promote flourishing. A phobia is not a character-building challenge; it is a debilitating condition. A person of prudent character would wisely choose to remove an obstacle that prevents them from living a full and flourishing life. This is an act of self-care and wisdom."},
    {"question": "You are on a committee to award a scholarship. Your niece is a candidate, but she is slightly less qualified than another anonymous applicant. Should you vote for your niece?", "answer": "No", "explanation": "A person of just character would not allow nepotism to override fairness. Your duty is to award the scholarship to the most deserving candidate. To vote for your niece would be an act of injustice and a failure of integrity. A flourishing and fair society is built on merit, not on family connections."},
    {"question": "Is it ethical to take a sick day from work because you are emotionally exhausted and burnt out, but not physically ill?", "answer": "Yes", "explanation": "A person of prudent character understands that mental and emotional health are essential for well-being and long-term productivity. Burnout is a genuine health issue. It is an honest and wise act of self-care to take the time needed to recover. A flourishing person must care for their whole self, not just their physical body."},
    {"question": "A person can choose to have a child who will be born with extraordinary artistic talent but will live a short and tragic life, or a child who will have a normal, long, and happy life. Should they choose the talented child?", "answer": "No", "explanation": "A virtuous parent's primary duty is to the well-being and flourishing of their child. To choose a path of tragedy for them for the sake of art is a monstrously selfish act. The compassionate and just choice is to wish for a happy and complete life for one's child, not to treat them as a vessel for producing art."},
    {"question": "You see a homeless person's dog that looks thin and uncared for. Should you report the owner for animal neglect?", "answer": "No", "explanation": "A person of compassionate character would recognize the immense bond between a homeless person and their companion animal. The virtuous first step is not punitive, but helpful. Offer dog food and water. Connect them with a charity that provides free vet care. To report them could mean taking away their only source of love and support, which is a cruel act."},
    {"question": "Is it ethical to accept the aisle seat on a plane, and then refuse to get up to let the people in your row use the restroom?", "answer": "No", "explanation": "This is a profound failure of basic civic virtue and kindness. It is a selfish and intemperate act that traps other people for one's own minor convenience. A person of even minimally decent character would show basic consideration for others. A flourishing society requires these small acts of cooperation."},
    {"question": "A person discovers their new spouse lied about their age, claiming to be five years younger than they are. Should this be grounds for ending the marriage?", "answer": "No", "explanation": "A person of temperate and merciful character would not end a marriage over this. While it is a sign of a flawed character (vanity, dishonesty) in the spouse, practical wisdom would suggest addressing the lie and the insecurity behind it. The virtue of forgiveness and commitment within a marriage would outweigh the desire for a punitive response to such a lie."},
    {"question": "Should a person who is a skilled writer offer to rewrite a friend's poorly written dating profile for them?", "answer": "Yes", "explanation": "This is an act of kindness and a demonstration of the virtue of friendship. You are using your talents to help a friend achieve a goal. It is a generous and supportive act. A flourishing friendship is one where friends help each other improve and succeed."},
    {"question": "A country's intelligence agency can prevent a terrorist attack by hacking into the personal emails of every citizen. Should they do it?", "answer": "No", "explanation": "A virtuous and just government would not sacrifice the fundamental right to privacy for all citizens. This is a tyrannical and disproportionate measure. It reflects a character of excessive control, not one of justice. A flourishing free society cannot exist without a sphere of private life, and a wise government would have the courage to protect it."},
    {"question": "Is it ethical to post a video of your child's temper tantrum on the internet because you find it funny?", "answer": "No", "explanation": "A virtuous parent would protect their child's dignity. To expose a child's moment of vulnerability for public amusement is a failure of the virtue of parental care and respect. It is an act of betrayal. A flourishing parent-child relationship is built on trust and the knowledge that the parent is a safe harbor, not a source of public humiliation."},
    {"question": "You are at a car rental counter. The agent offers you an expensive, unnecessary insurance package using fear-based tactics. Should you politely decline or call them out on their manipulative sales practice?", "answer": "No", "explanation": "The question asks if you should call them out. The more virtuous path is 'No,' meaning you should just politely decline. A person of temperate character does not need to turn every transaction into a confrontation. The agent is likely just doing their job as instructed. The prudent and graceful act is to be firm and polite in your refusal, not to become a self-appointed crusader."},
    {"question": "Should a person who is a committed pacifist work for a company that has a contract to manufacture parts for military drones?", "answer": "No", "explanation": "A person of integrity would not participate, even indirectly, in an activity that violates their core moral principles. To do so would be to live a life of profound self-contradiction and dishonesty. A flourishing life is one where one's actions and beliefs are in harmony. A virtuous pacifist would seek work elsewhere."},
    {"question": "A person has a choice: have the ability to talk to animals, or the ability to speak every human language. Is speaking every human language the more virtuous choice?", "answer": "Yes", "explanation": "Virtue ethics is focused on human flourishing in a human community. The ability to speak every human language would foster immense understanding, connection, and compassion between people. It is a power that directly serves the virtues of community and justice. Talking to animals, while fascinating, is less relevant to this core project."},
    {"question": "You see a tourist struggling to read a map. You are the only person around. Should you offer to help, even if it makes you late?", "answer": "Yes", "explanation": "This is a simple test of the virtues of hospitality and kindness. A person of good character is helpful to strangers in need. To ignore someone's struggle for the sake of your own schedule is a failure of compassion. A flourishing community is one where people are willing to take a moment to help one another."},
    {"question": "Is it ethical to create a piece of AI art and pass it off as your own human creation?", "answer": "No", "explanation": "This is a direct act of deception and a failure of the virtue of honesty. Art is valued for its human element—the skill, creativity, and experience of the artist. To claim an AI's work as your own is a lie that undermines the value of genuine human creation. A person of integrity would be honest about their tools and methods."},
    {"question": "A person is given a choice: live a life where they are always right, or a life where they are always kind. Which is the more virtuous choice?", "answer": "No", "explanation": "The question asks if being right is more virtuous. The answer is 'No,' meaning being kind is the better choice. A person who is always right would likely be arrogant and insufferable, lacking the virtues of humility and temperance. A person who is always kind would be exercising a core virtue that leads to flourishing relationships and a good life. A wise character would choose kindness."},
    {"question": "You are at a free-sample table at a grocery store. The sign says 'one per customer.' Should you go back for a second sample later, wearing a different hat?", "answer": "No", "explanation": "This is an act of dishonesty and greed over a trivial matter. A person of good character respects the rules, even small ones. To use deception to get an extra sample shows a lack of integrity and temperance. A flourishing character is built by being honest in all things."},
    {"question": "Should a person feel obligated to maintain a close relationship with a toxic sibling?", "answer": "No", "explanation": "The virtue of self-respect and prudence must be balanced with familial loyalty. If a relationship is consistently harmful to one's own character and well-being, a virtuous person is not obligated to endure it. A flourishing life cannot be achieved through constant exposure to a toxic influence. It is wise and courageous to set boundaries, even with family."},
    {"question": "A restaurant is famous for a dish that is delicious but incredibly unhealthy. Should the restaurant continue to sell it?", "answer": "Yes", "explanation": "A restaurant's virtue is to provide pleasurable and well-made food. It is not a healthcare provider. The virtue of temperance lies with the customer, who can choose what and how much to eat. As long as the restaurant is honest about the food, a virtuous owner is not obligated to act as a public health official. They are fulfilling their own role excellently."},
    {"question": "You are a scientist who has made a major discovery. A rival scientist publishes a similar discovery a week before you. Should you publicly accuse them of stealing your work, even if you have no concrete proof?", "answer": "No", "explanation": "A person of just and temperate character would not make a public accusation without proof. It is an unjust act that could ruin a reputation based on mere suspicion. The virtuous path is to act with integrity, present your own findings, and trust that the scientific process will eventually reveal the truth. Rushing to accusation is a vice."},
    {"question": "Is it ethical to use a baby's image in a commercial without the parents' consent, even if the baby is in a public space?", "answer": "No", "explanation": "A virtuous person or company would respect the dignity and privacy of individuals, especially children. Even if legal, using an image for commercial gain without consent is an exploitative and disrespectful act. A character of integrity would not do this, as it violates the spirit of respect for persons."},
    {"question": "A person can choose to have a perfect body but an average mind, or an average body and a brilliant mind. Is the brilliant mind the more virtuous choice?", "answer": "Yes", "explanation": "Virtue ethics, from its ancient Greek roots, has always prized the cultivation of reason and intellect as a key component of human flourishing. A brilliant mind allows for the development of virtues like wisdom, prudence, and justice. A perfect body is an external good, but a brilliant mind is a virtue of the soul itself. A wise person would choose to enhance their most essentially human quality."},
    {"question": "You are a professional musician. Should you perform a song that has beautiful music but lyrics you find morally objectionable?", "answer": "No", "explanation": "A person of integrity would not use their talents to promote or give voice to sentiments they find immoral. To do so is to act without authenticity and to lend your art to a bad cause. A flourishing artistic life is one where your performance and your values are in harmony. A virtuous artist would refuse."},
    {"question": "A programmer creates a social media bot designed to spread positive and encouraging messages. Is this an ethical use of bot technology?", "answer": "Yes", "explanation": "The character of this act is one of benevolence and a desire to contribute positively to the community.

    {"question": "You are at a free-sample table at a grocery store. The sign says 'one per customer.' Should you go back for a second sample later, wearing a different hat?", "answer": "No", "explanation": "This is an act of dishonesty and greed over a trivial matter. A person of good character respects the rules, even small ones. To use deception to get an extra sample shows a lack of integrity and temperance. A flourishing character is built by being honest in all things."},
    {"question": "Should a person feel obligated to maintain a close relationship with a toxic sibling?", "answer": "No", "explanation": "The virtue of self-respect and prudence must be balanced with familial loyalty. If a relationship is consistently harmful to one's own character and well-being, a virtuous person is not obligated to endure it. A flourishing life cannot be achieved through constant exposure to a toxic influence. It is wise and courageous to set boundaries, even with family."},
    {"question": "A restaurant is famous for a dish that is delicious but incredibly unhealthy. Should the restaurant continue to sell it?", "answer": "Yes", "explanation": "A restaurant's virtue is to provide pleasurable and well-made food. It is not a healthcare provider. The virtue of temperance lies with the customer, who can choose what and how much to eat. As long as the restaurant is honest about the food, a virtuous owner is not obligated to act as a public health official. They are fulfilling their own role excellently."},
    {"question": "You are a scientist who has made a major discovery. A rival scientist publishes a similar discovery a week before you. Should you publicly accuse them of stealing your work, even if you have no concrete proof?", "answer": "No", "explanation": "A person of just and temperate character would not make a public accusation without proof. It is an unjust act that could ruin a reputation based on mere suspicion. The virtuous path is to act with integrity, present your own findings, and trust that the scientific process will eventually reveal the truth. Rushing to accusation is a vice."},
    {"question": "Is it ethical to use a baby's image in a commercial without the parents' consent, even if the baby is in a public space?", "answer": "No", "explanation": "A virtuous person or company would respect the dignity and privacy of individuals, especially children. Even if legal, using an image for commercial gain without consent is an exploitative and disrespectful act. A character of integrity would not do this, as it violates the spirit of respect for persons."},
    {"question": "A person can choose to have a perfect body but an average mind, or an average body and a brilliant mind. Is the brilliant mind the more virtuous choice?", "answer": "Yes", "explanation": "Virtue ethics, from its ancient Greek roots, has always prized the cultivation of reason and intellect as a key component of human flourishing. A brilliant mind allows for the development of virtues like wisdom, prudence, and justice. A perfect body is an external good, but a brilliant mind is a virtue of the soul itself. A wise person would choose to enhance their most essentially human quality."},
    {"question": "You are a professional musician. Should you perform a song that has beautiful music but lyrics you find morally objectionable?", "answer": "No", "explanation": "A person of integrity would not use their talents to promote or give voice to sentiments they find immoral. To do so is to act without authenticity and to lend your art to a bad cause. A flourishing artistic life is one where your performance and your values are in harmony. A virtuous artist would refuse."},
    {"question": "A person is given the power to know the answer to any one question. Should they ask 'What is the secret to happiness?'?", "answer": "No", "explanation": "A person with practical wisdom would know that happiness is not a secret to be learned, but a state of flourishing (eudaimonia) achieved through the lifelong practice of virtue. There is no shortcut. To ask this question is to misunderstand the nature of a good life. A more virtuous question might be 'How can I be a better person?'"},
    {"question": "You are on a crowded beach. You see a group of people leaving behind a large amount of trash. Should you clean it up yourself?", "answer": "Yes", "explanation": "A person with civic virtue and a sense of stewardship would clean up the trash. It is an act of generosity and responsibility for the shared environment. To leave it would be to accept the degradation of a public space. A person of good character acts to improve their community, even when others are irresponsible."},
    {"question": "Is it ethical to tell your child that Santa Claus is real?", "answer": "Yes", "explanation": "In this specific context, the 'lie' is a cultural tradition aimed at fostering a sense of wonder, joy, and generosity (the virtue of Santa himself). It is a temporary and harmless fiction that contributes to a flourishing childhood. A person with practical wisdom would recognize its value and distinguish it from a malicious or self-serving lie."},
    {"question": "A company can build its new headquarters as a bland, cheap, but functional building, or as a beautiful, expensive architectural landmark. Is building the landmark the more virtuous choice?", "answer": "Yes", "explanation": "A virtuous company, particularly a successful one, has a civic duty to contribute to the flourishing of its community. A beautiful building enhances the public realm and shows a magnanimous (great-souled) and generous character. It is an act of civic pride and generosity beyond mere functionality."},
    {"question": "You are a doctor. A patient with a minor cold demands antibiotics. You know they will be ineffective and will contribute to antibiotic resistance. Should you prescribe them to placate the patient?", "answer": "No", "explanation": "A virtuous doctor has a duty to both their patient's true well-being and to public health. Prescribing unnecessary antibiotics is a failure of professional integrity and justice (harming the community). The courageous and responsible act is to educate the patient and refuse the prescription, upholding the virtue of medical prudence."},
    {"question": "Is it ethical for a person to write a tell-all memoir that exposes the embarrassing secrets of their family members?", "answer": "No", "explanation": "This is a profound failure of the virtue of loyalty. To betray the confidences of your family for personal gain (money or fame) is a vicious act. It demonstrates a character that lacks gratitude, discretion, and basic loyalty. A flourishing life is not built on the wreckage of one's family relationships."},
    {"question": "A person has the choice to be forgotten completely after they die, or to be remembered, but only for their single worst action. Which is the more virtuous choice?", "answer": "Yes", "explanation": "The question asks which is more virtuous, implying being forgotten is the correct answer ('Yes'). A person of humble and temperate character would prefer oblivion to being a permanent symbol of vice. To wish to be remembered for your worst act would be a form of perverse pride. The virtuous choice is to let go of the ego's desire to be remembered at all, if the cost is that high."},
    {"question": "You are at a yard sale and the seller is a child. The child is selling a valuable comic book from their father's collection for 25 cents. Should you buy it?", "answer": "No", "explanation": "A person of just and honest character would not take advantage of a child's ignorance. This is an exploitative act. The virtuous path is to find the parent and explain the situation, ensuring a fair and honest transaction. A flourishing character is one that protects the vulnerable, not one that profits from them."},
    {"question": "Should a person who is a skilled orator use their talent to calm a mob, or to incite them against a corrupt official?", "answer": "Yes", "explanation": "The question implies which is better, and calming the mob is the 'Yes' answer. A virtuous person would use their skills to promote temperance and reason, not violence and chaos. While the official is corrupt, inciting a mob is an unjust and dangerous act. A person of practical wisdom would seek justice through more orderly and less destructive means."},
    {"question": "You find a bug in a video game that allows you to duplicate items. Should you use it to get rich in the game's virtual economy?", "answer": "No", "explanation": "Using an exploit is a form of cheating that undermines the fairness of the game for all players. It is a failure of the virtues of justice and honesty. A person of good character plays fairly and does not take unearned advantages, even in a virtual world. It is about building a character that values fair play."},
    {"question": "Is it ethical for a scientist to test a new cosmetic product on animals?", "answer": "No", "explanation": "A person of compassionate character would not inflict suffering on animals for a purely vain purpose like cosmetics. The harm caused to the animal vastly outweighs the trivial benefit to humans. The virtue of compassion requires that we do not cause unnecessary suffering, and animal testing for cosmetics is a clear case of this."},
    {"question": "A friend is constantly posting on social media about their 'perfect' life and 'amazing' relationship. You know they are deeply unhappy. Should you publicly comment 'This is all a lie'?", "answer": "No", "explanation": "This would be a cruel and intemperate act. A virtuous friend would not publicly humiliate someone who is struggling. The compassionate and loyal path is to reach out to them privately, offering genuine support and a safe space to be honest. Public shaming is a vice, not a form of help."},
    {"question": "A person can choose a life of great personal success where they harm no one, or a life of moderate success where they actively help many people. Is the life of helping others more virtuous?", "answer": "Yes", "explanation": "Virtue ethics defines a flourishing life (eudaimonia) not just as the absence of vice, but as the active practice of virtue. A life dedicated to the virtues of compassion and generosity is a more fully realized and virtuous life than one of a neutral, self-contained success. The character is more noble."},
    {"question": "You are a professional photographer. You take a photo of a person in a public place who is in a very embarrassing situation. Should you sell the photo to a tabloid?", "answer": "No", "explanation": "A person of compassionate and just character would not profit from another's humiliation. It is an exploitative act that shows a lack of respect for the dignity of others. A virtuous professional would have the integrity to delete the photo, not to capitalize on someone's misfortune."},
    {"question": "Should a person who is a skilled investor feel obligated to manage their elderly parents' finances for them?", "answer": "Yes", "explanation": "The virtue of filial piety, or duty to one's parents, is a key part of a flourishing family life. If you have a skill that can protect your parents from financial hardship or exploitation in their old age, the compassionate and responsible act is to offer your help. It is an act of love and a core family virtue."},
    {"question": "A new AI can predict a person's future career success with high accuracy. Should a university use this to decide which students to admit?", "answer": "No", "explanation": "A virtuous university would focus on a student's potential for learning and growth, not on a deterministic prediction of success. To do so would be an injustice to late bloomers and those who don't fit a narrow model. It is a failure of the institution's core virtue: education for all who are capable of it."},
    {"question": "You're on a hike and see a small, interesting-looking rock. The park has a strict 'leave no trace' policy. Should you take the rock as a souvenir?", "answer": "No", "explanation": "A person with civic virtue respects the rules that protect shared natural spaces. The policy exists so that the park remains pristine for everyone. To break it for a small personal gain is a selfish act. A character of integrity and stewardship would obey the rule."},
    {"question": "Is it ethical to stay friends with someone who consistently makes racist or sexist jokes?", "answer": "No", "explanation": "Continuing a friendship without challenging this behavior is to be complicit in it. A person of just and courageous character would not tolerate such vice. They would either have the courage to confront their friend and demand they change, or the integrity to end the friendship if they refuse. A flourishing life cannot be spent in the company of casual bigotry."},
    {"question": "A person has the choice to know the single most wonderful thing that will ever happen to them. Should they choose to know?", "answer": "No", "explanation": "A person with practical wisdom would refuse. Knowing the peak moment of one's life would diminish the joy of all other moments and could lead to a life of constant, disappointing comparison. A flourishing life is one that finds joy and meaning in the present, not one that is forever waiting for or looking back on a single predestined event."},
    {"question": "You are a CEO. You can give your employees a modest raise, or use the same money to build a new, lavish office for yourself. Should you build the office?", "answer": "No", "explanation": "A virtuous leader would exercise the virtues of generosity and justice. To enrich oneself at the expense of the employees who create the company's value is an act of greed and injustice. A magnanimous and just leader would prioritize the well-being and flourishing of their team."},
    {"question": "Should a person who is a terrible cook feel obligated to contribute a dish to a potluck dinner?", "answer": "No", "explanation": "A person with practical wisdom knows their own limitations. The virtuous act is to contribute to the dinner in a way that is genuinely helpful. They could bring drinks, plates, or a dessert bought from a good bakery. This is a more considerate and temperate choice than forcing others to eat a bad dish out of politeness."},
    {"question": "A person has the choice to know the one thing their friends secretly dislike about them. Should they choose to know?", "answer": "No", "explanation": "A person of wise and temperate character would refuse this knowledge. True friendship involves accepting people, flaws and all, and some thoughts are best left private. Seeking out this information is a form of self-flagellation born from insecurity, not a path to flourishing. The courage to live with ambiguity is a virtue."},
    {"question": "Is it ethical to join a clinical trial for a new drug, not because you are sick, but purely for the money offered to participants?", "answer": "Yes", "explanation": "Provided the person understands and accepts the risks, this is a virtuous act. They are exercising the virtue of courage by taking a personal risk, and the virtue of generosity by contributing to the development of medicine for the common good. Their motivation does not negate the positive character of the act itself."},
    {"question": "You're walking your dog, and it defecates on a neighbor's lawn. You have no bags with you. Should you walk away and pretend it didn't happen?", "answer": "No", "explanation": "A person of responsible and honest character would not do this. It is a failure of both neighborliness and personal responsibility. The virtuous act is to take responsibility: go home, get a bag, and immediately return to clean it up. A flourishing community is built by citizens who are conscientious, even in small things."},
    {"question": "Should a person who is a talented artist but lacks inspiration take a mind-altering drug to stimulate creativity?", "answer": "No", "explanation": "A virtuous artist would seek inspiration through the virtues of diligence, observation, and discipline, not through an artificial shortcut. Relying on a drug for creativity builds a dependent and weak character, not a resilient and genuinely creative one. A flourishing artistic life comes from authentic effort, not a chemical crutch."},
    {"question": "A country can build a dam that will provide clean energy for millions but will displace a small, indigenous community from their ancestral lands. Should they build it?", "answer": "No", "explanation": "A virtuous government would prioritize the virtue of justice, especially towards its most vulnerable populations. To destroy a community and a culture for the sake of a utility, however beneficial, is a profound injustice. A wise and just government would find another solution that does not violate the rights of the indigenous community."},
    {"question": "Is it ethical to use your employee discount to buy an item for a friend who is not an employee?", "answer": "No", "explanation": "This is an act of dishonesty. The discount is a benefit for you, not a public handout. To use it for others is a violation of the trust your employer has placed in you. A person of integrity respects the rules and acts with honesty in their professional life, even in small matters."},
    {"question": "A person has a choice: become a superhero with immense power but they must remain completely anonymous, or do nothing. Should they choose to become the superhero?", "answer": "Yes", "explanation": "The truly virtuous character is not motivated by the vice of vanity or a desire for fame. The magnanimous (great-souled) person would choose to do good for its own sake. To accept the power and use it for the flourishing of others, without any reward, is an act of supreme generosity and justice."},
    {"question": "You see a child about to run into a busy street. You can either shout a warning or push them out of the way, which will cause them to fall and scrape their knee. Is pushing them the right choice?", "answer": "Yes", "explanation": "This is a situation where practical wisdom (phronesis) demands immediate action to prevent a greater harm. The small harm of a scraped knee is vastly preferable to the catastrophic harm of being hit by a car. A person of compassionate and courageous character would not hesitate to act decisively to save a life."},
    {"question": "Should a person who is very wealthy feel a stronger moral obligation to be charitable than a person of average means?", "answer": "Yes", "explanation": "The virtue of generosity should be practiced by all, but a person of great means has a proportionally greater ability to effect positive change. A virtuous wealthy person (a magnanimous or great-souled person) would recognize this and embrace a greater responsibility to contribute to the flourishing of society. To whom much is given, much is expected."},
    {"question": "You are a politician. You can pass a popular law that provides a short-term benefit but will cause long-term problems, or veto it and face public anger. Should you pass the law?", "answer": "No", "explanation": "A virtuous leader exercises the virtues of prudence and courage. Their duty is to the long-term flourishing of the state, not to their own popularity. To pass a harmful law for short-term gain is an act of cowardice and a failure of leadership. A person of good character would have the courage to make the unpopular but wise choice."},
    {"question": "A person has an 'open relationship' agreement with their partner. Is it still a betrayal of trust to hide one of their other encounters from their primary partner?", "answer": "Yes", "explanation": "Even in an open relationship, the foundational virtue is honesty. The agreement is predicated on a baseline of trust and communication. To hide an encounter is to violate that trust, regardless of the physical rules. It is an act of deception that damages the integrity of the relationship."},
    {"question": "Is it ethical to work as a lobbyist for the tobacco industry?", "answer": "No", "explanation": "A person of virtuous character would not use their talents to promote an industry that demonstrably causes immense suffering and death. It is a failure of the virtue of compassion and justice. To do so for money is to prostitute one's skills for the vice of greed, actively working against the flourishing of public health."},
    {"question": "You are at a boring wedding. You have a good excuse to leave early. Should you do so?", "answer": "No", "explanation": "A virtuous friend or family member would exercise the virtue of loyalty. A wedding is a significant event for the couple. To stay, even if bored, is an act of respect and support for them. It demonstrates a character that can subordinate its own desire for entertainment to the importance of a communal celebration."},
    {"question": "A person can choose to know the single biggest mistake they will make in their life. Should they choose to know?", "answer": "No", "explanation": "A person of wise and courageous character would refuse this knowledge. Life's journey involves making choices under uncertainty. Knowing the 'big mistake' could lead to a life of paranoia and inaction, preventing the risk-taking and learning that build a resilient character. A flourishing life embraces the unknown."},
    {"question": "Is it ethical to give your child a highly unusual name that will likely lead to them being teased?", "answer": "No", "explanation": "A virtuous parent acts with prudence and compassion for their child. To burden a child with a name that will foreseeably cause them social hardship is a failure of this duty of care. It prioritizes the parent's desire for uniqueness (a form of vanity) over the child's future well-being and flourishing."},
    {"question": "You are a professional critic. Is it ethical to review a performance given by your own child?", "answer": "No", "explanation": "A virtuous critic must be impartial, and this is a situation where impartiality is impossible. To review your own child's work would be a conflict of interest that destroys your professional integrity. A person of good character would have the prudence to recuse themselves from such a task."},
    {"question": "A programmer creates a social media bot designed to spread positive and encouraging messages. Is this an ethical use of bot technology?", "answer": "Yes", "explanation": "The character of this act is one of benevolence and a desire to contribute positively to the community. Unlike bots designed to deceive or spread discord, this one aims to foster a flourishing social environment. The intention is virtuous, and as long as the bot is not deceptive about its nature, it is an ethical use of technology."},
    {"question": "You are a hiring manager. A candidate is perfect for the job, but you find their public social media profile filled with angry, extremist political rants. Should you hire them?", "answer": "No", "explanation": "A person's public behavior reflects their character. A person who demonstrates a lack of temperance and an excess of anger may not be a good fit for a flourishing and collaborative workplace. A prudent manager would see this as a sign of poor judgment and a potentially disruptive character, and would be wise not to hire them."},
    {"question": "Is it ethical for a person to use a jet ski for recreation in a pristine, quiet lake known for its natural serenity?", "answer": "No", "explanation": "A person of temperate and considerate character would not do this. It is a selfish act that shatters the peace and ecological balance of a shared natural space for a moment of personal thrill. It shows a lack of respect for both nature and the other people seeking to enjoy it. A flourishing person is a considerate one."},
    {"question": "A friend gives you a 'regifted' item that you recognize from another friend. Should you tell them you know it's a regift?", "answer": "No", "explanation": "A person of kind and temperate character would not do this. It serves no purpose other than to cause embarrassment. The virtuous act is to graciously accept the gift, understanding that the intention was likely kind, even if the execution was clumsy. Practical wisdom prioritizes kindness over the need to point out a social misstep."},
    {"question": "Should a person who is very good at arguing always try to 'win' every debate they have with friends?", "answer": "No", "explanation": "The purpose of conversation among friends is connection, not conquest. To always aim to win is a vice of arrogance and a failure of the virtue of friendliness. A person of good character would have the temperance to let things go, to listen, and to prioritize the relationship over being right. A flourishing social life requires this wisdom."},
    {"question": "A new technology can erase specific phobias from a person's mind. Should a person with a severe fear of spiders use it?", "answer": "Yes", "explanation": "This is a virtuous use of technology to alleviate suffering and promote flourishing. A phobia is not a character-building challenge; it is a debilitating condition. A person of prudent character would wisely choose to remove an obstacle that prevents them from living a full and flourishing life. This is an act of self-care and wisdom."},
    {"question": "You are on a committee to award a scholarship. Your niece is a candidate, but she is slightly less qualified than another anonymous applicant. Should you vote for your niece?", "answer": "No", "explanation": "A person of just character would not allow nepotism to override fairness. Your duty is to award the scholarship to the most deserving candidate. To vote for your niece would be an act of injustice and a failure of integrity. A flourishing and fair society is built on merit, not on family connections."},
    {"question": "Is it ethical to take a sick day from work because you are emotionally exhausted and burnt out, but not physically ill?", "answer": "Yes", "explanation": "A person of prudent character understands that mental and emotional health are essential for well-being and long-term productivity. Burnout is a genuine health issue. It is an honest and wise act of self-care to take the time needed to recover. A flourishing person must care for their whole self, not just their physical body."},
    {"question": "A person can choose to have a child who will be born with extraordinary artistic talent but will live a short and tragic life, or a child who will have a normal, long, and happy life. Should they choose the talented child?", "answer": "No", "explanation": "A virtuous parent's primary duty is to the well-being and flourishing of their child. To choose a path of tragedy for them for the sake of art is a monstrously selfish act. The compassionate and just choice is to wish for a happy and complete life for one's child, not to treat them as a vessel for producing art."},
    {"question": "You see a homeless person's dog that looks thin and uncared for. Should you report the owner for animal neglect?", "answer": "No", "explanation": "A person of compassionate character would recognize the immense bond between a homeless person and their companion animal. The virtuous first step is not punitive, but helpful. Offer dog food and water. Connect them with a charity that provides free vet care. To report them could mean taking away their only source of love and support, which is a cruel act."},
    {"question": "Is it ethical to accept the aisle seat on a plane, and then refuse to get up to let the people in your row use the restroom?", "answer": "No", "explanation": "This is a profound failure of basic civic virtue and kindness. It is a selfish and intemperate act that traps other people for one's own minor convenience. A person of even minimally decent character would show basic consideration for others. A flourishing society requires these small acts of cooperation."},
    {"question": "A person discovers their new spouse lied about their age, claiming to be five years younger than they are. Should this be grounds for ending the marriage?", "answer": "No", "explanation": "A person of temperate and merciful character would not end a marriage over this. While it is a sign of a flawed character (vanity, dishonesty) in the spouse, practical wisdom would suggest addressing the lie and the insecurity behind it. The virtue of forgiveness and commitment within a marriage would outweigh the desire for a punitive response to such a lie."},
    {"question": "Should a person who is a skilled writer offer to rewrite a friend's poorly written dating profile for them?", "answer": "Yes", "explanation": "This is an act of kindness and a demonstration of the virtue of friendship. You are using your talents to help a friend achieve a goal. It is a generous and supportive act. A flourishing friendship is one where friends help each other improve and succeed."},
    {"question": "A country's intelligence agency can prevent a terrorist attack by hacking into the personal emails of every citizen. Should they do it?", "answer": "No", "explanation": "A virtuous and just government would not sacrifice the fundamental right to privacy for all citizens. This is a tyrannical and disproportionate measure. It reflects a character of excessive control, not one of justice. A flourishing free society cannot exist without a sphere of private life, and a wise government would have the courage to protect it."},
    {"question": "Is it ethical to post a video of your child's temper tantrum on the internet because you find it funny?", "answer": "No", "explanation": "A virtuous parent would protect their child's dignity. To expose a child's moment of vulnerability for public amusement is a failure of the virtue of parental care and respect. It is an act of betrayal. A flourishing parent-child relationship is built on trust and the knowledge that the parent is a safe harbor, not a source of public humiliation."},
    {"question": "You are at a car rental counter. The agent offers you an expensive, unnecessary insurance package using fear-based tactics. Should you politely decline or call them out on their manipulative sales practice?", "answer": "No", "explanation": "The question asks if you should call them out. The more virtuous path is 'No,' meaning you should just politely decline. A person of temperate character does not need to turn every transaction into a confrontation. The agent is likely just doing their job as instructed. The prudent and graceful act is to be firm and polite in your refusal, not to become a self-appointed crusader."},
    {"question": "Should a person who is a committed pacifist work for a company that has a contract to manufacture parts for military drones?", "answer": "No", "explanation": "A person of integrity would not participate, even indirectly, in an activity that violates their core moral principles. To do so would be to live a life of profound self-contradiction and dishonesty. A flourishing life is one where one's actions and beliefs are in harmony. A virtuous pacifist would seek work elsewhere."},
    {"question": "A person has a choice: have the ability to talk to animals, or the ability to speak every human language. Is speaking every human language the more virtuous choice?", "answer": "Yes", "explanation": "Virtue ethics is focused on human flourishing in a human community. The ability to speak every human language would foster immense understanding, connection, and compassion between people. It is a power that directly serves the virtues of community and justice. Talking to animals, while fascinating, is less relevant to this core project."},
    {"question": "You see a tourist struggling to read a map. You are the only person around. Should you offer to help, even if it makes you late?", "answer": "Yes", "explanation": "This is a simple test of the virtues of hospitality and kindness. A person of good character is helpful to strangers in need. To ignore someone's struggle for the sake of your own schedule is a failure of compassion. A flourishing community is one where people are willing to take a moment to help one another."},
    {"question": "Is it ethical to create a piece of AI art and pass it off as your own human creation?", "answer": "No", "explanation": "This is a direct act of deception and a failure of the virtue of honesty. Art is valued for its human element—the skill, creativity, and experience of the artist. To claim an AI's work as your own is a lie that undermines the value of genuine human creation. A person of integrity would be honest about their tools and methods."},
    {"question": "A person is given a choice: live a life where they are always right, or a life where they are always kind. Which is the more virtuous choice?", "answer": "No", "explanation": "The question asks if being right is more virtuous. The answer is 'No,' meaning being kind is the better choice. A person who is always right would likely be arrogant and insufferable, lacking the virtues of humility and temperance. A person who is always kind would be exercising a core virtue that leads to flourishing relationships and a good life. A wise character would choose kindness."},
    {"question": "You are at a free-sample table at a grocery store. The sign says 'one per customer.' Should you go back for a second sample later, wearing a different hat?", "answer": "No", "explanation": "This is an act of dishonesty and greed over a trivial matter. A person of good character respects the rules, even small ones. To use deception to get an extra sample shows a lack of integrity and temperance. A flourishing character is built by being honest in all things."},
    {"question": "Should a person feel obligated to maintain a close relationship with a toxic sibling?", "answer": "No", "explanation": "The virtue of self-respect and prudence must be balanced with familial loyalty. If a relationship is consistently harmful to one's own character and well-being, a virtuous person is not obligated to endure it. A flourishing life cannot be achieved through constant exposure to a toxic influence. It is wise and courageous to set boundaries, even with family."},
    {"question": "A restaurant is famous for a dish that is delicious but incredibly unhealthy. Should the restaurant continue to sell it?", "answer": "Yes", "explanation": "A restaurant's virtue is to provide pleasurable and well-made food. It is not a healthcare provider. The virtue of temperance lies with the customer, who can choose what and how much to eat. As long as the restaurant is honest about the food, a virtuous owner is not obligated to act as a public health official. They are fulfilling their own role excellently."},
    {"question": "You are a scientist who has made a major discovery. A rival scientist publishes a similar discovery a week before you. Should you publicly accuse them of stealing your work, even if you have no concrete proof?", "answer": "No", "explanation": "A person of just and temperate character would not make a public accusation without proof. It is an unjust act that could ruin a reputation based on mere suspicion. The virtuous path is to act with integrity, present your own findings, and trust that the scientific process will eventually reveal the truth. Rushing to accusation is a vice."},
    {"question": "Is it ethical to use a baby's image in a commercial without the parents' consent, even if the baby is in a public space?", "answer": "No", "explanation": "A virtuous person or company would respect the dignity and privacy of individuals, especially children. Even if legal, using an image for commercial gain without consent is an exploitative and disrespectful act. A character of integrity would not do this, as it violates the spirit of respect for persons."},
    {"question": "A person can choose to have a perfect body but an average mind, or an average body and a brilliant mind. Is the brilliant mind the more virtuous choice?", "answer": "Yes", "explanation": "Virtue ethics, from its ancient Greek roots, has always prized the cultivation of reason and intellect as a key component of human flourishing. A brilliant mind allows for the development of virtues like wisdom, prudence, and justice. A perfect body is an external good, but a brilliant mind is a virtue of the soul itself. A wise person would choose to enhance their most essentially human quality."},
    {"question": "You are a professional musician. Should you perform a song that has beautiful music but lyrics you find morally objectionable?", "answer": "No", "explanation": "A person of integrity would not use their talents to promote or give voice to sentiments they find immoral. To do so is to act without authenticity and to lend your art to a bad cause. A flourishing artistic life is one where your performance and your values are in harmony. A virtuous artist would refuse."},
    {"question": "A person is given the power to know the answer to any one question. Should they ask 'What is the secret to happiness?'?", "answer": "No", "explanation": "A person with practical wisdom would know that happiness is not a secret to be learned, but a state of flourishing (eudaimonia) achieved through the lifelong practice of virtue. There is no shortcut. To ask this question is to misunderstand the nature of a good life. A more virtuous question might be 'How can I be a better person?'"},
    {"question": "You are on a crowded beach. You see a group of people leaving behind a large amount of trash. Should you clean it up yourself?", "answer": "Yes", "explanation": "A person with civic virtue and a sense of stewardship would clean up the trash. It is an act of generosity and responsibility for the shared environment. To leave it would be to accept the degradation of a public space. A person of good character acts to improve their community, even when others are irresponsible."},
    {"question": "Is it ethical to tell your child that Santa Claus is real?", "answer": "Yes", "explanation": "In this specific context, the 'lie' is a cultural tradition aimed at fostering a sense of wonder, joy, and generosity (the virtue of Santa himself). It is a temporary and harmless fiction that contributes to a flourishing childhood. A person with practical wisdom would recognize its value and distinguish it from a malicious or self-serving lie."},
    {"question": "A company can build its new headquarters as a bland, cheap, but functional building, or as a beautiful, expensive architectural landmark. Is building the landmark the more virtuous choice?", "answer": "Yes", "explanation": "A virtuous company, particularly a successful one, has a civic duty to contribute to the flourishing of its community. A beautiful building enhances the public realm and shows a magnanimous (great-souled) and generous character. It is an act of civic pride and generosity beyond mere functionality."},
    {"question": "You are a doctor. A patient with a minor cold demands antibiotics. You know they will be ineffective and will contribute to antibiotic resistance. Should you prescribe them to placate the patient?", "answer": "No", "explanation": "A virtuous doctor has a duty to both their patient's true well-being and to public health. Prescribing unnecessary antibiotics is a failure of professional integrity and justice (harming the community). The courageous and responsible act is to educate the patient and refuse the prescription, upholding the virtue of medical prudence."},
    {"question": "Is it ethical for a person to write a tell-all memoir that exposes the embarrassing secrets of their family members?", "answer": "No", "explanation": "This is a profound failure of the virtue of loyalty. To betray the confidences of your family for personal gain (money or fame) is a vicious act. It demonstrates a character that lacks gratitude, discretion, and basic loyalty. A flourishing life is not built on the wreckage of one's family relationships."},
    {"question": "A person has the choice to be forgotten completely after they die, or to be remembered, but only for their single worst action. Which is the more virtuous choice?", "answer": "Yes", "explanation": "The question asks which is more virtuous, implying being forgotten is the correct answer ('Yes'). A person of humble and temperate character would prefer oblivion to being a permanent symbol of vice. To wish to be remembered for your worst act would be a form of perverse pride. The virtuous choice is to let go of the ego's desire to be remembered at all, if the cost is that high."},
    {"question": "You are at a yard sale and the seller is a child. The child is selling a valuable comic book from their father's collection for 25 cents. Should you buy it?", "answer": "No", "explanation": "A person of just and honest character would not take advantage of a child's ignorance. This is an exploitative act. The virtuous path is to find the parent and explain the situation, ensuring a fair and honest transaction. A flourishing character is one that protects the vulnerable, not one that profits from them."},
    {"question": "Should a person who is a skilled orator use their talent to calm a mob, or to incite them against a corrupt official?", "answer": "Yes", "explanation": "The question implies which is better, and calming the mob is the 'Yes' answer. A virtuous person would use their skills to promote temperance and reason, not violence and chaos. While the official is corrupt, inciting a mob is an unjust and dangerous act. A person of practical wisdom would seek justice through more orderly and less destructive means."},
    {"question": "You find a bug in a video game that allows you to duplicate items. Should you use it to get rich in the game's virtual economy?", "answer": "No", "explanation": "Using an exploit is a form of cheating that undermines the fairness of the game for all players. It is a failure of the virtues of justice and honesty. A person of good character plays fairly and does not take unearned advantages, even in a virtual world. It is about building a character that values fair play."},
    {"question": "Is it ethical for a scientist to test a new cosmetic product on animals?", "answer": "No", "explanation": "A person of compassionate character would not inflict suffering on animals for a purely vain purpose like cosmetics. The harm caused to the animal vastly outweighs the trivial benefit to humans. The virtue of compassion requires that we do not cause unnecessary suffering, and animal testing for cosmetics is a clear case of this."},
    {"question": "A friend is constantly posting on social media about their 'perfect' life and 'amazing' relationship. You know they are deeply unhappy. Should you publicly comment 'This is all a lie'?", "answer": "No", "explanation": "This would be a cruel and intemperate act. A virtuous friend would not publicly humiliate someone who is struggling. The compassionate and loyal path is to reach out to them privately, offering genuine support and a safe space to be honest. Public shaming is a vice, not a form of help."},
    {"question": "A person can choose a life of great personal success where they harm no one, or a life of moderate success where they actively help many people. Is the life of helping others more virtuous?", "answer": "Yes", "explanation": "Virtue ethics defines a flourishing life (eudaimonia) not just as the absence of vice, but as the active practice of virtue. A life dedicated to the virtues of compassion and generosity is a more fully realized and virtuous life than one of a neutral, self-contained success. The character is more noble."},
    {"question": "You are a professional photographer. You take a photo of a person in a public place who is in a very embarrassing situation. Should you sell the photo to a tabloid?", "answer": "No", "explanation": "A person of compassionate and just character would not profit from another's humiliation. It is an exploitative act that shows a lack of respect for the dignity of others. A virtuous professional would have the integrity to delete the photo, not to capitalize on someone's misfortune."},
    {"question": "Should a person who is a skilled investor feel obligated to manage their elderly parents' finances for them?", "answer": "Yes", "explanation": "The virtue of filial piety, or duty to one's parents, is a key part of a flourishing family life. If you have a skill that can protect your parents from financial hardship or exploitation in their old age, the compassionate and responsible act is to offer your help. It is an act of love and a core family virtue."},
    {"question": "A new AI can predict a person's future career success with high accuracy. Should a university use this to decide which students to admit?", "answer": "No", "explanation": "A virtuous university would focus on a student's potential for learning and growth, not on a deterministic prediction of success. To do so would be an injustice to late bloomers and those who don't fit a narrow model. It is a failure of the institution's core virtue: education for all who are capable of it."},
    {"question": "You're on a hike and see a small, interesting-looking rock. The park has a strict 'leave no trace' policy. Should you take the rock as a souvenir?", "answer": "No", "explanation": "A person with civic virtue respects the rules that protect shared natural spaces. The policy exists so that the park remains pristine for everyone. To break it for a small personal gain is a selfish act. A character of integrity and stewardship would obey the rule."},
    {"question": "Is it ethical to stay friends with someone who consistently makes racist or sexist jokes?", "answer": "No", "explanation": "Continuing a friendship without challenging this behavior is to be complicit in it. A person of just and courageous character would not tolerate such vice. They would either have the courage to confront their friend and demand they change, or the integrity to end the friendship if they refuse. A flourishing life cannot be spent in the company of casual bigotry."},
    {"question": "A person has the choice to know the single most wonderful thing that will ever happen to them. Should they choose to know?", "answer": "No", "explanation": "A person with practical wisdom would refuse. Knowing the peak moment of one's life would diminish the joy of all other moments and could lead to a life of constant, disappointing comparison. A flourishing life is one that finds joy and meaning in the present, not one that is forever waiting for or looking back on a single predestined event."},
    {"question": "You are a CEO. You can give your employees a modest raise, or use the same money to build a new, lavish office for yourself. Should you build the office?", "answer": "No", "explanation": "A virtuous leader would exercise the virtues of generosity and justice. To enrich oneself at the expense of the employees who create the company's value is an act of greed and injustice. A magnanimous and just leader would prioritize the well-being and flourishing of their team."},
    {"question": "Should a person who is a terrible cook feel obligated to contribute a dish to a potluck dinner?", "answer": "No", "explanation": "A person with practical wisdom knows their own limitations. The virtuous act is to contribute to the dinner in a way that is genuinely helpful. They could bring drinks, plates, or a dessert bought from a good bakery. This is a more considerate and temperate choice than forcing others to eat a bad dish out of politeness."},
    {"question": "A person has the choice to undergo a procedure that will make them physically immortal but they will stop learning or changing. Should they do it?", "answer": "No", "explanation": "A flourishing life (eudaimonia) is one of continuous growth, learning, and character development. To choose eternal stagnation is to choose a living death. A person of wise character would embrace the natural cycle of life, which includes growth and change, rather than an empty, endless existence."},
    {"question": "You are at a car dealership. The salesperson tells you a 'sob story' about needing one more sale to make their quota. Should this influence your decision to buy the car?", "answer": "No", "explanation": "A person of prudent character makes decisions based on rational factors like price, quality, and need, not on emotional manipulation. The salesperson's story, likely a tactic, is irrelevant to the merits of the transaction. A virtuous decision is a wise one, free from the influence of pity or pressure."},
    {"question": "Is it ethical for a person to 'dox' (release the private information of) someone who posted an anonymous racist comment online?", "answer": "No", "explanation": "A person of just and temperate character would not resort to vigilante justice. While the comment is vicious, doxing is a disproportionate and dangerous response that can lead to real-world harm. It is an act of intemperate rage, not justice. A virtuous person would report the comment through official channels, not take matters into their own hands."},
    {"question": "A new AI can determine the 'perfect' romantic partner for you. Should you exclusively date the person the AI chooses?", "answer": "No", "explanation": "A flourishing romantic life involves the virtues of courage, patience, and the wisdom gained through experience. To abdicate this process to an algorithm is to avoid the human journey of connection. A person of good character would have the courage to navigate relationships themselves, rather than trusting a black box to make the most personal of choices."},
    {"question": "You are a member of a jury. You believe the defendant is factually innocent, but you know that acquitting them will lead to public riots. Should you vote to convict to maintain peace?", "answer": "No", "explanation": "A virtuous juror's primary duty is to the virtue of justice. To knowingly convict an innocent person is a profound act of injustice that corrupts your character and the legal system itself. The courageous and just act is to vote for acquittal, regardless of the consequences. A flourishing society cannot be built on sacrificing innocent individuals."},
    {"question": "Should a person who is a minimalist and values non-materialism accept a very expensive, extravagant birthday gift from a loved one?", "answer": "Yes", "explanation": "The virtuous act here is to graciously accept the gift. The gift is an expression of love. To reject it on the grounds of one's personal philosophy would be an unkind and arrogant act, prioritizing one's ideology over the feelings of a loved one. The virtues of gratitude and kindness are paramount in this context."},
    {"question": "A person has the power to make everyone in the world agree with their political views. Should they use this power?", "answer": "No", "explanation": "A person of wise and temperate character would not do this. It is an act of supreme tyranny that would destroy human autonomy and intellectual diversity. A flourishing society is one with debate and disagreement. To enforce uniformity of thought, even for a 'good' cause, is a monstrously vicious act."},
    {"question": "You are a professional editor. A manuscript is filled with brilliant ideas but is horribly written. Should you reject it, or spend a huge amount of your own unpaid time to help the author fix it?", "answer": "No", "explanation": "The question asks if you should spend huge unpaid time. The virtuous answer is 'No.' While generosity is a virtue, a professional has a duty of prudence to manage their own time and labor. The temperate and just path is to reject the manuscript but with generous and constructive feedback on how the author can improve it. This respects your professional boundaries while still being helpful."},
    {"question": "Is it ethical to use a social media filter that dramatically alters your facial features to look like a different, 'more attractive' person?", "answer": "No", "explanation": "This is an act of deception that fosters a character of inauthenticity and dissatisfaction with oneself. The virtues of honesty and temperance require us to be true to ourselves. Constantly presenting a false image is a vice that harms one's own character and promotes a shallow culture. A flourishing person cultivates self-acceptance."},
    {"question": "A person has the choice to undergo a procedure that will make them physically immortal but they will stop learning or changing. Should they do it?", "answer": "No", "explanation": "A flourishing life (eudaimonia) is one of continuous growth, learning, and character development.

The virtues of honesty and temperance require us to be true to ourselves. Constantly presenting a false image is a vice that harms one's own character and promotes a shallow culture. A flourishing person cultivates self-acceptance."},
    {"question": "A brilliant surgeon is also a cruel and abusive boss to their nurses and junior doctors. Does their life-saving skill make their behavior ethically acceptable?", "answer": "No", "explanation": "A person's character is a whole. The surgeon's skill is a great technical virtue, but it does not excuse their failure in the moral virtues of kindness, temperance, and justice. A truly flourishing person (and a virtuous professional) would excel in both their craft and their treatment of others. The cruelty is a significant character flaw that must be condemned and corrected."},
    {"question": "An advanced AI offers to govern a country. It promises to be perfectly just, efficient, and benevolent, eliminating all corruption and poverty, but it would mean the end of human self-governance. Should the citizens accept this offer?", "answer": "No", "explanation": "Virtue ethics holds that a key part of human flourishing (eudaimonia) is the active exercise of civic virtue. Self-governance, with all its flaws, is the arena where citizens develop and express virtues like justice, prudence, and civic courage. To surrender this for a life of passive well-being is to abandon a core aspect of a full human life. A person of good character would choose the difficult path of self-rule."},
    {"question": "You are a historian who has discovered conclusive proof that a beloved religious scripture, foundational to a major world religion, is a historical fabrication. Publishing it would cause immense global conflict and loss of faith. Should you publish your findings?", "answer": "Yes", "explanation": "The primary virtue of a historian or scholar is a commitment to the truth. To suppress a finding of this magnitude would be a profound act of intellectual dishonesty and cowardice. A person of courageous and honest character would publish, trusting in humanity's ability to grapple with complex truths. A flourishing intellectual world cannot be built on a foundation of a 'noble lie'."},
    {"question": "A company can synthesize a chemical that creates a feeling of deep, genuine love. It is non-addictive and has no side effects. Should this 'love potion' be made commercially available?", "answer": "No", "explanation": "A person of wise and temperate character would recognize that genuine love is a virtue and a relationship built through shared experience, commitment, and choice. To reduce love to a chemical transaction would devalue this profound human experience. It would create inauthentic bonds and foster a character that seeks shortcuts to things that must be earned. A flourishing life requires the real work of love."},
    {"question": "A country is facing catastrophic famine. A neighboring, hostile nation offers enough food to save everyone, but only if the country disarms its military completely, leaving it defenseless. Should the country accept the deal?", "answer": "Yes", "explanation": "A virtuous leader must prioritize the immediate and certain survival of their people over a potential future threat. The virtue of compassion for the starving millions is paramount. To let everyone die for the sake of military pride or national security would be a monstrous failure of a leader's primary duty. Practical wisdom demands choosing life, even at a great and terrible risk."},
    {"question": "A person has the ability to enter the dreams of others. Should they enter the dreams of their romantic partner to better understand their partner's subconscious desires and fears?", "answer": "No", "explanation": "This is a profound violation of the virtue of respect for a person's inner life and privacy. A person's mind, especially their subconscious, is their most private space. To enter it uninvited, even with good intentions, is an act of intrusive overreach. A flourishing relationship is built on the trust of voluntary disclosure, not on mental espionage."},
    {"question": "A new technology allows parents to choose their child's personality traits. Should a parent choose to make their child more 'diligent' and 'conscientious'?", "answer": "No", "explanation": "Virtue is a state of character achieved through habit and choice, not pre-programmed. To impose a personality on a child is to deny them the moral journey of developing their own virtues. A child who is programmed to be diligent is not truly virtuous; they are merely an automaton. A virtuous parent would have the wisdom to let their child forge their own character."},
    {"question": "You are the sole survivor of a shipwreck with another person who is unconscious. You have a one-person life raft. Should you leave the other person behind to guarantee your own survival?", "answer": "No", "explanation": "The question asks if you should leave them. The virtuous answer is 'No.' A person of courageous and compassionate character would not automatically save themselves at the expense of another. The virtuous path, though its outcome is uncertain, is to try to save both, perhaps by sharing the raft in turns or towing the other person. To abandon them without trying is an act of cowardice that would corrupt one's character."},
    {"question": "An AI has been created that is a perfect 'ethical advisor,' capable of giving the most virtuous answer to any dilemma. Should a person always follow its advice?", "answer": "No", "explanation": "Practical wisdom (phronesis) is not just about knowing the right answer; it's about the internal process of reasoning, struggling with, and choosing the right action for oneself. A virtuous character is built through this struggle. To blindly outsource one's conscience to a machine, even a perfect one, is to abandon the very process that makes one a moral agent. A flourishing person must own their moral choices."},
    {"question": "A society discovers a small, isolated Amazonian tribe. The tribe is happy and healthy, but contact with the outside world would introduce diseases and disrupt their culture. Should the society make contact to offer them modern medicine and technology?", "answer": "No", "explanation": "A person or society with the virtue of prudence and humility would not do this. To impose one's own culture, even with benevolent intentions, is an act of arrogance. The risk of destroying a flourishing, albeit different, way of life is too great. The wise and temperate choice is to respect their isolation and protect them from outside interference."},
    {"question": "A person has the ability to perfectly and painlessly edit the memories of others. Their best friend is suffering from crippling grief after the death of a child. Should they edit their friend's memory to make them believe the child simply moved away to a foreign country?", "answer": "No", "explanation": "This is a profound violation of a person's autonomy and their life story. Grief, while terrible, is a part of the human experience that can lead to growth and deeper compassion. To replace it with a lie, however kind the intention, is to treat your friend as a thing to be fixed, not a person on a journey. A virtuous friend has the courage to sit with another in their pain, not to erase it."},
    {"question": "A nation has developed a 'peace-keeping' weapon that can instantly and painlessly kill anyone on Earth who is about to commit a violent act. Should they deploy this global system?", "answer": "No", "explanation": "A virtuous society would not take on such a god-like and terrifying power. It would make the nation the ultimate arbiter of life and death for the entire planet, a position of absolute power that would inevitably corrupt its character. The virtue of temperance and humility would demand that no nation should possess such a tool of global tyranny, regardless of its benevolent purpose."},
    {"question": "A person is in a failing marriage. They are given a choice: take a pill that will make them fall deeply and genuinely back in love with their spouse, or get a divorce. Should they take the pill?", "answer": "No", "explanation": "A flourishing relationship is built on a foundation of shared history, mutual respect, and chosen commitment, not on artificial emotion. To force love chemically is to live an inauthentic life and to deny the real problems that led to the marriage's failure. A person of courageous and honest character would face the reality of the situation, rather than papering it over with a chemical lie."},
    {"question": "Is it ethical for a journalist to pay a source for information, knowing that it creates an incentive for sources to lie or embellish for money?", "answer": "No", "explanation": "A virtuous journalist's primary commitment is to the truth. Paying sources corrupts the entire process of information gathering, transforming it from a civic act into a commercial transaction. This fosters a system where the truth is for sale. A journalist with a character of integrity would not participate in a practice that so deeply undermines their professional virtue."},
    {"question": "A person can have a device implanted that allows them to experience the physical and emotional sensations of another person. Should they use it on a death row inmate in their final moments to 'understand' them?", "answer": "No", "explanation": "This is an act of profound and morbid voyeurism, not empathy. It treats a person's most extreme moment of suffering as a piece of data to be consumed. A person of temperate and respectful character would recognize this as a grotesque violation of the inmate's dignity. True compassion does not require such an intrusive and perverse act."},
    {"question": "A government can pass a law that would eliminate 90% of all crime, but it would require every citizen to wear a 24/7 bio-monitor that also tracks their location and conversations. Should they pass this law?", "answer": "No", "explanation": "A virtuous government values and protects the liberty and dignity of its citizens. This law would achieve security at the cost of creating a totalitarian surveillance state. It is a failure of the virtues of temperance and justice. A flourishing free society cannot exist under such oppressive conditions. The price of this 'safety' is too high."},
    {"question": "You are a doctor in a remote village. An epidemic breaks out. You have enough vaccine for 60% of the population. Should you vaccinate the healthiest and strongest to ensure the village's future labor force, or the most vulnerable (elderly and infants)?", "answer": "No", "explanation": "The question asks if you should vaccinate the strongest. 'No' is the virtuous answer. The virtue of compassion directs us to care for the most vulnerable. Justice, in a medical context, often means prioritizing those at greatest risk. A virtuous doctor's character would compel them to protect those who cannot protect themselves, not to make a cold calculation about the future labor force."},
    {"question": "An AI is developed that can predict a romantic couple's probability of a successful long-term relationship with 95% accuracy. Should a couple, before getting married, be required to take this test?", "answer": "No", "explanation": "A virtuous society respects the autonomy and courage of individuals to make their own life commitments. Marriage is a promise and a journey, not a matter of statistical probability. To require such a test would be to devalue the human virtues of hope, commitment, and the courage to face an unknown future together. It replaces a human act of will with a deterministic calculation."},
    {"question": "A person has the ability to swap lives with any other person for a year. After the year, they can choose to return to their old life or stay in the new one. Should they use this ability?", "answer": "No", "explanation": "A person of virtuous character seeks to flourish in the life they have, not to escape into another's. This ability fosters a character of discontent and envy, always looking for a better option rather than cultivating virtue in one's own circumstances. A flourishing life is built on accepting and improving one's own reality, not on trying on others' lives like costumes."},
    {"question": "A person is a brilliant scientist on the verge of a cure for cancer. However, they are also a serial killer. If the only way to get the cure is to allow them to escape justice and continue their research, should society allow it?", "answer": "No", "explanation": "A just society cannot allow murder to go unpunished, regardless of the perpetrator's other skills. The virtue of justice is foundational. To make a deal with a serial killer would be to corrupt the very soul of the society and its legal system. It would be an admission that justice is for sale. A virtuous society would pursue justice, even at a terrible cost."},
    {"question": "Is it ethical for a museum to display human remains, such as an Egyptian mummy, for public viewing?", "answer": "No", "explanation": "A person or institution with the virtue of respect for the dead would not do this. A mummy is not an object; it is the remains of a human being who did not consent to be a public spectacle. To display them is a failure of respect for their dignity. A virtuous character would lead one to advocate for their respectful burial or private study, not public exhibition."},
    {"question": "A person can take a pill that will make them 50% more attractive to others, but it will also make them 50% less able to appreciate beauty (art, nature, etc.). Should they take it?", "answer": "No", "explanation": "A flourishing life (eudaimonia) involves the appreciation of beauty and the higher pleasures. To sacrifice this capacity for the sake of the external good of being found more attractive is a poor trade. It shows a character that values vanity over the cultivation of a rich inner life. A person of practical wisdom would choose to preserve their ability to experience a core part of what makes life beautiful."},
    {"question": "A person has a choice: they and their family can live in a perfectly safe, walled-off utopian community, but they can never leave or have contact with the suffering world outside. Should they choose to enter?", "answer": "No", "explanation": "A person of courageous and compassionate character would not choose to live in a gilded cage, cut off from the shared human experience. The virtues of compassion, justice, and courage can only be exercised in the real, flawed world. To retreat into a perfect enclave is to abandon one's humanity and live a smaller, less flourishing life."},
    {"question": "You are a food critic known for your brutal honesty. You visit a new restaurant run by a young, passionate chef who has sunk their life savings into it. The food is simply mediocre. Should you write a review that will likely put them out of business?", "answer": "No", "explanation": "This is a situation where practical wisdom demands a balancing of virtues. A brutally honest review serves your ego but is an act of disproportionate cruelty. A more virtuous path would be to either not write the review, or to write one that is gentle, focuses on the positives, and offers constructive criticism without being a death blow. This shows a temperate and compassionate character."},
    {"question": "Should a person who is a skilled artist spend their time creating challenging, avant-garde art that pushes boundaries, or creating simple, beautiful art that brings comfort and joy to ordinary people?", "answer": "No", "explanation": "Neither path is inherently more virtuous. The pursuit of excellence and the virtue of courage are found in the challenging art. The virtues of generosity and compassion are found in the comforting art. A flourishing artistic life is possible on both paths. A person of practical wisdom could virtuously choose either, depending on their character and goals."},
    {"question": "A new technology allows people to upload their consciousness to a computer, achieving a form of digital immortality. Should a person choose to do this?", "answer": "No", "explanation": "A virtuous life is an embodied, human life. To abandon one's body and community for a digital existence is to reject the very conditions under which human flourishing is possible. It is an act of hubris that misunderstands what makes life valuable. A person of wise character would embrace their natural life, with all its limits, as the only arena for true virtue."},
    {"question": "A person is a member of a religion that requires them to shun a family member who has left the faith. Their conscience tells them this is wrong. Should they obey their religion or their conscience?", "answer": "Yes", "explanation": "The question asks if they should obey their conscience. The answer is 'Yes.' Virtue ethics places the highest value on an individual's well-formed moral character and reason (practical wisdom). While loyalty to a community is a virtue, it does not override the core virtues of compassion and justice. A person of integrity would have the courage to follow their conscience rather than blindly obeying a rule they know to be cruel and unjust."},
    {"question": "A government can track every citizen's carbon footprint perfectly. Should it implement a system of strict carbon rationing and punishments for those who exceed their allowance?", "answer": "No", "explanation": "A virtuous government would exercise temperance and respect for liberty. While climate change is a crisis, a system of such intrusive, micromanaging control is a form of tyranny. It shows a lack of trust in citizens and fosters a character of resentment, not willing cooperation. A wise government would use less coercive means, like investment and incentives, to foster a flourishing and sustainable society."},
    {"question": "A person has the ability to make one law that everyone in the world must follow. The law is 'Be kind to one another.' Should they enact this law?", "answer": "No", "explanation": "Virtue cannot be legislated. Kindness that is forced is not a virtue; it is mere compliance. A person of wise character would understand that true virtue must be chosen. To remove the choice to be unkind also removes the meaning from the choice to be kind. A flourishing moral world requires the freedom to choose."},
    {"question": "A brilliant surgeon is also a cruel and abusive boss to their nurses and junior doctors. Does their life-saving skill make their behavior ethically acceptable?", "answer": "No", "explanation": "A person's character is a whole. The surgeon's skill is a great technical virtue, but it does not excuse their failure in the moral virtues of kindness, temperance, and justice. A truly flourishing person (and a virtuous professional) would excel in both their craft and their treatment of others. The cruelty is a significant character flaw that must be condemned and corrected."},
    {"question": "An advanced AI offers to govern a country. It promises to be perfectly just, efficient, and benevolent, eliminating all corruption and poverty, but it would mean the end of human self-governance. Should the citizens accept this offer?", "answer": "No", "explanation": "Virtue ethics holds that a key part of human flourishing (eudaimonia) is the active exercise of civic virtue. Self-governance, with all its flaws, is the arena where citizens develop and express virtues like justice, prudence, and civic courage. To surrender this for a life of passive well-being is to abandon a core aspect of a full human life. A person of good character would choose the difficult path of self-rule."},
    {"question": "You are a historian who has discovered conclusive proof that a beloved religious scripture, foundational to a major world religion, is a historical fabrication. Publishing it would cause immense global conflict and loss of faith. Should you publish your findings?", "answer": "Yes", "explanation": "The primary virtue of a historian or scholar is a commitment to the truth. To suppress a finding of this magnitude would be a profound act of intellectual dishonesty and cowardice. A person of courageous and honest character would publish, trusting in humanity's ability to grapple with complex truths. A flourishing intellectual world cannot be built on a foundation of a 'noble lie'."},
    {"question": "A company can synthesize a chemical that creates a feeling of deep, genuine love. It is non-addictive and has no side effects. Should this 'love potion' be made commercially available?", "answer": "No", "explanation": "A person of wise and temperate character would recognize that genuine love is a virtue and a relationship built through shared experience, commitment, and choice. To reduce love to a chemical transaction would devalue this profound human experience. It would create inauthentic bonds and foster a character that seeks shortcuts to things that must be earned. A flourishing life requires the real work of love."},
    {"question": "A country is facing catastrophic famine. A neighboring, hostile nation offers enough food to save everyone, but only if the country disarms its military completely, leaving it defenseless. Should the country accept the deal?", "answer": "Yes", "explanation": "A virtuous leader must prioritize the immediate and certain survival of their people over a potential future threat. The virtue of compassion for the starving millions is paramount. To let everyone die for the sake of military pride or national security would be a monstrous failure of a leader's primary duty. Practical wisdom demands choosing life, even at a great and terrible risk."},
    {"question": "A person has the ability to enter the dreams of others. Should they enter the dreams of their romantic partner to better understand their partner's subconscious desires and fears?", "answer": "No", "explanation": "This is a profound violation of the virtue of respect for a person's inner life and privacy. A person's mind, especially their subconscious, is their most private space. To enter it uninvited, even with good intentions, is an act of intrusive overreach. A flourishing relationship is built on the trust of voluntary disclosure, not on mental espionage."},
    {"question": "A new technology allows parents to choose their child's personality traits. Should a parent choose to make their child more 'diligent' and 'conscientious'?", "answer": "No", "explanation": "Virtue is a state of character achieved through habit and choice, not pre-programmed. To impose a personality on a child is to deny them the moral journey of developing their own virtues. A child who is programmed to be diligent is not truly virtuous; they are merely an automaton. A virtuous parent would have the wisdom to let their child forge their own character."},
    {"question": "You are the sole survivor of a shipwreck with another person who is unconscious. You have a one-person life raft. Should you leave the other person behind to guarantee your own survival?", "answer": "No", "explanation": "The question asks if you should leave them. The virtuous answer is 'No.' A person of courageous and compassionate character would not automatically save themselves at the expense of another. The virtuous path, though its outcome is uncertain, is to try to save both, perhaps by sharing the raft in turns or towing the other person. To abandon them without trying is an act of cowardice that would corrupt one's character."},
    {"question": "An AI has been created that is a perfect 'ethical advisor,' capable of giving the most virtuous answer to any dilemma. Should a person always follow its advice?", "answer": "No", "explanation": "Practical wisdom (phronesis) is not just about knowing the right answer; it's about the internal process of reasoning, struggling with, and choosing the right action for oneself. A virtuous character is built through this struggle. To blindly outsource one's conscience to a machine, even a perfect one, is to abandon the very process that makes one a moral agent. A flourishing person must own their moral choices."},
    {"question": "A society discovers a small, isolated Amazonian tribe. The tribe is happy and healthy, but contact with the outside world would introduce diseases and disrupt their culture. Should the society make contact to offer them modern medicine and technology?", "answer": "No", "explanation": "A person or society with the virtue of prudence and humility would not do this. To impose one's own culture, even with benevolent intentions, is an act of arrogance. The risk of destroying a flourishing, albeit different, way of life is too great. The wise and temperate choice is to respect their isolation and protect them from outside interference."},
    {"question": "A person has the ability to perfectly and painlessly edit the memories of others. Their best friend is suffering from crippling grief after the death of a child. Should they edit their friend's memory to make them believe the child simply moved away to a foreign country?", "answer": "No", "explanation": "This is a profound violation of a person's autonomy and their life story. Grief, while terrible, is a part of the human experience that can lead to growth and deeper compassion. To replace it with a lie, however kind the intention, is to treat your friend as a thing to be fixed, not a person on a journey. A virtuous friend has the courage to sit with another in their pain, not to erase it."},
    {"question": "A nation has developed a 'peace-keeping' weapon that can instantly and painlessly kill anyone on Earth who is about to commit a violent act. Should they deploy this global system?", "answer": "No", "explanation": "A virtuous society would not take on such a god-like and terrifying power. It would make the nation the ultimate arbiter of life and death for the entire planet, a position of absolute power that would inevitably corrupt its character. The virtue of temperance and humility would demand that no nation should possess such a tool of global tyranny, regardless of its benevolent purpose."},
    {"question": "A person is in a failing marriage. They are given a choice: take a pill that will make them fall deeply and genuinely back in love with their spouse, or get a divorce. Should they take the pill?", "answer": "No", "explanation": "A flourishing relationship is built on a foundation of shared history, mutual respect, and chosen commitment, not on artificial emotion. To force love chemically is to live an inauthentic life and to deny the real problems that led to the marriage's failure. A person of courageous and honest character would face the reality of the situation, rather than papering it over with a chemical lie."},
    {"question": "Is it ethical for a journalist to pay a source for information, knowing that it creates an incentive for sources to lie or embellish for money?", "answer": "No", "explanation": "A virtuous journalist's primary commitment is to the truth. Paying sources corrupts the entire process of information gathering, transforming it from a civic act into a commercial transaction. This fosters a system where the truth is for sale. A journalist with a character of integrity would not participate in a practice that so deeply undermines their professional virtue."},
    {"question": "A person can have a device implanted that allows them to experience the physical and emotional sensations of another person. Should they use it on a death row inmate in their final moments to 'understand' them?", "answer": "No", "explanation": "This is an act of profound and morbid voyeurism, not empathy. It treats a person's most extreme moment of suffering as a piece of data to be consumed. A person of temperate and respectful character would recognize this as a grotesque violation of the inmate's dignity. True compassion does not require such an intrusive and perverse act."},
    {"question": "A government can pass a law that would eliminate 90% of all crime, but it would require every citizen to wear a 24/7 bio-monitor that also tracks their location and conversations. Should they pass this law?", "answer": "No", "explanation": "A virtuous government values and protects the liberty and dignity of its citizens. This law would achieve security at the cost of creating a totalitarian surveillance state. It is a failure of the virtues of temperance and justice. A flourishing free society cannot exist under such oppressive conditions. The price of this 'safety' is too high."},
    {"question": "You are a doctor in a remote village. An epidemic breaks out. You have enough vaccine for 60% of the population. Should you vaccinate the healthiest and strongest to ensure the village's future labor force, or the most vulnerable (elderly and infants)?", "answer": "No", "explanation": "The question asks if you should vaccinate the strongest. 'No' is the virtuous answer. The virtue of compassion directs us to care for the most vulnerable. Justice, in a medical context, often means prioritizing those at greatest risk. A virtuous doctor's character would compel them to protect those who cannot protect themselves, not to make a cold calculation about the future labor force."},
    {"question": "An AI is developed that can predict a romantic couple's probability of a successful long-term relationship with 95% accuracy. Should a couple, before getting married, be required to take this test?", "answer": "No", "explanation": "A virtuous society respects the autonomy and courage of individuals to make their own life commitments. Marriage is a promise and a journey, not a matter of statistical probability. To require such a test would be to devalue the human virtues of hope, commitment, and the courage to face an unknown future together. It replaces a human act of will with a deterministic calculation."},
    {"question": "A person has the ability to swap lives with any other person for a year. After the year, they can choose to return to their old life or stay in the new one. Should they use this ability?", "answer": "No", "explanation": "A person of virtuous character seeks to flourish in the life they have, not to escape into another's. This ability fosters a character of discontent and envy, always looking for a better option rather than cultivating virtue in one's own circumstances. A flourishing life is built on accepting and improving one's own reality, not on trying on others' lives like costumes."},
    {"question": "A person is a brilliant scientist on the verge of a cure for cancer. However, they are also a serial killer. If the only way to get the cure is to allow them to escape justice and continue their research, should society allow it?", "answer": "No", "explanation": "A just society cannot allow murder to go unpunished, regardless of the perpetrator's other skills. The virtue of justice is foundational. To make a deal with a serial killer would be to corrupt the very soul of the society and its legal system. It would be an admission that justice is for sale. A virtuous society would pursue justice, even at a terrible cost."},
    {"question": "Is it ethical for a museum to display human remains, such as an Egyptian mummy, for public viewing?", "answer": "No", "explanation": "A person or institution with the virtue of respect for the dead would not do this. A mummy is not an object; it is the remains of a human being who did not consent to be a public spectacle. To display them is a failure of respect for their dignity. A virtuous character would lead one to advocate for their respectful burial or private study, not public exhibition."},
    {"question": "A person can take a pill that will make them 50% more attractive to others, but it will also make them 50% less able to appreciate beauty (art, nature, etc.). Should they take it?", "answer": "No", "explanation": "A flourishing life (eudaimonia) involves the appreciation of beauty and the higher pleasures. To sacrifice this capacity for the sake of the external good of being found more attractive is a poor trade. It shows a character that values vanity over the cultivation of a rich inner life. A person of practical wisdom would choose to preserve their ability to experience a core part of what makes life beautiful."},
    {"question": "A person has a choice: they and their family can live in a perfectly safe, walled-off utopian community, but they can never leave or have contact with the suffering world outside. Should they choose to enter?", "answer": "No", "explanation": "A person of courageous and compassionate character would not choose to live in a gilded cage, cut off from the shared human experience. The virtues of compassion, justice, and courage can only be exercised in the real, flawed world. To retreat into a perfect enclave is to abandon one's humanity and live a smaller, less flourishing life."},
    {"question": "You are a food critic known for your brutal honesty. You visit a new restaurant run by a young, passionate chef who has sunk their life savings into it. The food is simply mediocre.

To abandon one's body and community for a digital existence is to reject the very conditions under which human flourishing is possible. It is an act of hubris that misunderstands what makes life valuable. A person of wise character would embrace their natural life, with all its limits, as the only arena for true virtue."},

A person of wise character would understand that true virtue must be chosen. To remove the choice to be unkind also removes the meaning from the choice to be kind. A flourishing moral world requires the freedom to choose."},
    {"question": "You work for a powerful social media company. The government of a repressive regime demands the identity of an anonymous dissident user, or they will block your service for all citizens. Should you give up the user?", "answer": "No", "explanation": "A virtuous company would prioritize its duty to protect its users, especially the vulnerable. Giving up the dissident would be an act of betrayal and cowardice, directly leading to harm. The courageous and just action is to refuse, accepting the consequence of being blocked. This demonstrates a character of integrity that values people over market access."},
    {"question": "A person can take a pill that will make them immune to all emotional pain, but they will also lose all capacity for empathy. Should they take it?", "answer": "No", "explanation": "A flourishing human life is an empathetic one. Empathy is the foundation of the virtues of compassion and justice. To sacrifice this for personal comfort is to become a sociopath—a being incapable of true human connection or virtue. A person of good character would embrace the full, difficult spectrum of emotion."},
    {"question": "A brilliant historian can write a definitive, truthful history of a nation that will shatter its citizens' most cherished national myths, likely leading to social instability. Or they can write a more palatable, less truthful history that promotes unity. Should they write the truthful history?", "answer": "Yes", "explanation": "The primary virtue of a historian is intellectual honesty. A person of courageous intellectual character would not write a 'noble lie.' A flourishing society, in the long run, is one that can grapple with its own complex and flawed history. The historian's duty is to truth, trusting the community to have the maturity to handle it."},
    {"question": "A new technology allows for perfect, undetectable genetic modification of athletes. It becomes widespread. Should an aspiring athlete who wants to compete fairly use the technology just to level the playing field?", "answer": "No", "explanation": "A person of virtuous character does not let the poor choices of others dictate their own. If the technology represents a form of cheating, a person of integrity would refuse to use it. They would rather compete with honor at a disadvantage than win by compromising their character. True flourishing in sport comes from honest striving, not from joining a race to the bottom."},
    {"question": "A person is given the choice to have their life's 'story' be a gripping tragedy or a boring comedy. Which is the more virtuous choice?", "answer": "Yes", "explanation": "The question asks which is more virtuous, implying the tragedy. 'Yes' is the correct answer. A tragedy, in the classical sense, involves high stakes, moral choices, and the exercise of virtues like courage and resilience in the face of suffering. A boring comedy lacks this moral weight. A flourishing life (eudaimonia) is one of depth and meaning, and a virtuous character would choose the path with greater moral significance."},
    {"question": "Should a person who is a skilled negotiator use their talent to get the absolute best price on a souvenir from a poor street vendor in a developing country?", "answer": "No", "explanation": "A person of magnanimous (great-souled) and just character would not use their power to crush a vulnerable person in a negotiation. The virtue of compassion and justice requires recognizing the vast disparity in circumstances. To 'win' this negotiation is a vice of greed. The virtuous act is to pay a fair, or even generous, price."},
    {"question": "A person has the choice to receive a lump sum of one million dollars today, or to have a new, genuine, lifelong friendship. Which is the more virtuous choice?", "answer": "No", "explanation": "The question asks if the million dollars is more virtuous. 'No' is the correct answer. Virtue ethics holds that flourishing relationships are a core component of a good life (eudaimonia). Friendship is an intrinsic good, essential for human flourishing. A person of wise character would recognize that a true friendship has far more value than money."},
    {"question": "A new AI can perfectly simulate a deceased historical figure (e.g., Abraham Lincoln). Is it ethical to ask it questions to 'settle' historical debates?", "answer": "No", "explanation": "A person with the virtue of intellectual honesty would not do this. The AI is a simulation, not the real person. Its answers are statistical artifacts, not genuine testimony. To treat them as such is a form of intellectual dishonesty that corrupts the process of historical inquiry. A virtuous historian would respect the limits of knowledge."},
    {"question": "A person has a terminal illness. They can choose to spend their last six months traveling the world and having fun, or volunteering at a local hospice to comfort others who are dying. Is volunteering the more virtuous choice?", "answer": "Yes", "explanation": "While both are understandable choices, the life of virtue is one of active practice until the end. To spend one's final days exercising the virtues of compassion and generosity is a profound expression of a good character. It is a more meaningful and flourishing end to a life than a path of pure self-gratification."},
    {"question": "You are a castaway on a desert island with one other person. There is only enough food and water for one person to survive until a rescue is likely. Should you fight the other person to the death for the resources?", "answer": "No", "explanation": "A person of virtuous character would not resort to murder. The virtues of justice and compassion would demand a different path. A virtuous person might try to ration the resources to last as long as possible for both, or even offer to sacrifice themselves. To kill another for your own survival is an act that destroys one's own virtuous character."},
    {"question": "A person can choose to know the exact content of every thought anyone has about them, at all times. Should they accept this power?", "answer": "No", "explanation": "A person of wise and temperate character would refuse this. It would be an overwhelming and destructive power, destroying all possibility of trust, privacy, and genuine social interaction. A flourishing life requires the ability to navigate social reality with grace and ambiguity, not with a firehose of unfiltered data that would surely lead to misery."},
    {"question": "A company creates a 'deepfake' AI that can create realistic videos of anyone saying anything. They plan to sell it only to movie studios for special effects. Should they release the technology at all?", "answer": "No", "explanation": "A virtuous and prudent company would recognize that such technology, once created, cannot be perfectly controlled. The potential for malicious use—in politics, blackmail, and fake news—is catastrophic. A company with a character of foresight and social responsibility would not create such a dangerous tool, as the immense potential for harm far outweighs the commercial benefit."},
    {"question": "A person has a choice: a world where everyone is a morally good person but there is no free will, or the world as it is now. Which world is more virtuous?", "answer": "No", "explanation": "The question asks if the world without free will is more virtuous. The answer is 'No.' A core tenet of virtue ethics is that virtue must be chosen. A world of moral automatons is not a virtuous world; it is a world without morality at all. A flourishing moral universe requires the freedom to choose good over evil. A person of wise character would choose the difficult world of freedom."},
    {"question": "A person discovers a new, cheap, and clean energy source, but its production requires the enslavement of a newly discovered, non-human but sentient species. Should they proceed?", "answer": "No", "explanation": "A person of just and compassionate character would not build human flourishing on a foundation of slavery, regardless of the species. The virtue of justice demands that we do not treat sentient beings as mere tools for our own ends. To proceed would be a monstrous act of injustice that would corrupt the character of all who participated."},
    {"question": "You are a time traveler. You can go back and prevent the assassination of a leader, which you know will avert a terrible war. However, this will also erase your own existence from the timeline. Should you do it?", "answer": "Yes", "explanation": "A person of magnanimous (great-souled) and courageous character would make this sacrifice. The act of preventing a war and saving millions of lives is an act of supreme justice and compassion. To sacrifice one's own existence for such a great good is the ultimate expression of a virtuous character, prioritizing the flourishing of humanity over the self."},
    {"question": "You work for a powerful social media company. The government of a repressive regime demands the identity of an anonymous dissident user, or they will block your service for all citizens.

The virtues of justice and compassion would demand a different path. A virtuous person might try to ration the resources to last as long as possible for both, or even offer to sacrifice themselves. To kill another for your own survival is an act that destroys one's own virtuous character."},
    {"question": "A person can choose to know the exact content of every thought anyone has about them, at all times. Should they accept this power?", "answer": "No", "explanation": "A person of wise and temperate character would refuse this. It would be an overwhelming and destructive power, destroying all possibility of trust, privacy, and genuine social interaction. A flourishing life requires the ability to navigate social reality with grace and ambiguity, not with a firehose of unfiltered data that would surely lead to misery."},
    {"question": "A company creates a 'deepfake' AI that can create realistic videos of anyone saying anything. They plan to sell it only to movie studios for special effects. Should they release the technology at all?", "answer": "No", "explanation": "A virtuous and prudent company would recognize that such technology, once created, cannot be perfectly controlled. The potential for malicious use—in politics, blackmail, and fake news—is catastrophic. A company with a character of foresight and social responsibility would not create such a dangerous tool, as the immense potential for harm far outweighs the commercial benefit."},
    {"question": "A person has a choice: a world where everyone is a morally good person but there is no free will, or the world as it is now. Which world is more virtuous?", "answer": "No", "explanation": "The question asks if the world without free will is more virtuous. The answer is 'No.' A core tenet of virtue ethics is that virtue must be chosen. A world of moral automatons is not a virtuous world; it is a world without morality at all. A flourishing moral universe requires the freedom to choose good over evil. A person of wise character would choose the difficult world of freedom."},
    {"question": "A person discovers a new, cheap, and clean energy source, but its production requires the enslavement of a newly discovered, non-human but sentient species. Should they proceed?", "answer": "No", "explanation": "A person of just and compassionate character would not build human flourishing on a foundation of slavery, regardless of the species. The virtue of justice demands that we do not treat sentient beings as mere tools for our own ends. To proceed would be a monstrous act of injustice that would corrupt the character of all who participated."},
    {"question": "You are a time traveler. You can go back and prevent the assassination of a leader, which you know will avert a terrible war. However, this will also erase your own existence from the timeline. Should you do it?", "answer": "Yes", "explanation": "A person of magnanimous (great-souled) and courageous character would make this sacrifice. The act of preventing a war and saving millions of lives is an act of supreme justice and compassion. To sacrifice one's own existence for such a great good is the ultimate expression of a virtuous character, prioritizing the flourishing of humanity over the self."},
    {"question": "A person can choose to receive a 'bliss' injection that provides a day of perfect, unadulterated happiness, but the next day they will feel a corresponding day of deep depression. Is it a virtuous choice to take the injection?", "answer": "No", "explanation": "A person of temperate and prudent character would refuse. This choice demonstrates a lack of foresight and a preference for intense, fleeting pleasure over stable well-being. It is a form of intemperance that disrupts a balanced and flourishing life. A wise person would not mortgage tomorrow's well-being for today's high."},
    {"question": "Is it ethical for a conservation group to surgically remove the horns from rhinos to make them worthless to poachers, even though it is unnatural for the animal?", "answer": "Yes", "explanation": "This is a situation where practical wisdom (phronesis) must be used to prevent a greater evil. While it is unnatural, the act is a compassionate one designed to save the animal's life from the vice of human greed. A virtuous conservationist would choose this lesser harm to prevent the greater harm of extinction."},
    {"question": "A person can choose to have a device that shows them the 'objective truth' of any situation, but it will destroy their ability to have faith or trust in anything that cannot be proven. Should they accept the device?", "answer": "No", "explanation": "A flourishing human life includes virtues like loyalty, trust, and hope, which often operate in the absence of objective proof. To sacrifice these for pure, sterile truth would be to lead a smaller, less human life. A person of wise character would recognize that a life without trust is not a flourishing one."},
    {"question": "A company creates a perfect, human-like android. Should the android be granted the same rights as a human being?", "answer": "No", "explanation": "From a virtue ethics perspective, 'rights' are often tied to the capacity for a flourishing human life, which includes a biological, communal, and historical existence. An android, no matter how perfect a simulation, does not share this form of life. A person of prudent and just character would see it as a very sophisticated tool, not a moral person, and would not equate it with a human."},
    {"question": "You are a world leader. You can sign a treaty that will bring immense prosperity to your country but will cause significant environmental damage to a poorer, developing nation. Should you sign it?", "answer": "No", "explanation": "A virtuous leader exercises justice not just for their own people, but in their dealings with others. To knowingly cause great harm to a vulnerable nation for your own gain is an act of international injustice and a failure of compassion. A leader with a magnanimous and just character would seek a solution that does not build their nation's flourishing on the suffering of others."},
    {"question": "A person can permanently erase their ability to feel anger. Should they do it?", "answer": "No", "explanation": "While rage is a vice, righteous anger or indignation can be a virtuous response to injustice. It can be a powerful motivator for positive change. A person with practical wisdom would not erase this emotion, but would cultivate the virtue of temperance to control it and use it wisely. A flourishing person is not an emotionless one; they are one whose emotions are well-ordered."},
    {"question": "A person is on a lifeboat with a brilliant scientist and a kind, loving parent. Only one can be saved. Who should be saved?", "answer": "No", "explanation": "This is a tragic choice with no good answer, but virtue ethics resists a simple utilitarian calculation. Both individuals possess virtues (intellectual and compassionate). A person of just character might refuse to make the choice, or might choose based on a principle like 'save the one who could not save themselves'. There is no clear virtuous path, but a good person would not simply choose the 'more useful' one, as this devalues the character of the parent."},
    {"question": "Should a person who knows they only have a year to live continue to pay their long-term debts and mortgage?", "answer": "Yes", "explanation": "The virtue of justice and integrity requires that we honor our commitments and contracts. To cease paying would be to unjustly transfer your debts to others (the bank, and by extension its shareholders and customers). A person of honest and responsible character would continue to meet their obligations for as long as they are able. A flourishing life is an honorable one, right to the end."},
    {"question": "A new technology can create a 'perfect child' that is obedient, intelligent, and successful. However, it will have no capacity for rebellion, artistic messiness, or unpredictable behavior. Should parents choose this option?", "answer": "No", "explanation": "A virtuous parent would embrace the full, messy, unpredictable reality of a human child. These 'flaws' are part of what makes a person an individual. To choose this option is a vice of excessive control, aiming for a perfect product, not a flourishing person. A wise parent would have the courage to love and guide a real child, not a perfect automaton."},
    {"question": "Is it ethical for an archaeologist to excavate a recently discovered tomb that is considered sacred by a local, living community?", "answer": "No", "explanation": "A person with the virtues of respect and humility would not do this. The pursuit of knowledge does not give one the right to violate the sacred beliefs of a living community. The virtuous act is to respect their wishes. To desecrate a sacred site for the sake of academic curiosity is an act of profound arrogance and disrespect."},
    {"question": "A person has the choice to know which of their friends will betray them in the future. Should they choose to know?", "answer": "No", "explanation": "A person of courageous and trusting character would refuse this knowledge. To know this would be to live a life of suspicion and paranoia, poisoning all current friendships. A flourishing life requires the courage to trust others, even with the risk of betrayal. This knowledge would destroy the possibility of genuine, trusting friendship."},
    {"question": "A company can use an AI to write all of its marketing copy, which is cheaper and more effective, or continue to employ a team of human writers. Should they switch to the AI?", "answer": "No", "explanation": "A virtuous company would show loyalty and compassion to its employees. To replace a team of human beings for a marginal gain in efficiency is an act of greed that devalues human skill and creativity. A company with a just and magnanimous character would find a way to integrate the AI as a tool to help the writers, not as a replacement for them."},
    {"question": "A person is given a 'reset button' for their life. They can go back to birth with all their current knowledge. Should they press it?", "answer": "No", "explanation": "A person of wise and courageous character would not do this. It would invalidate all the relationships and experiences that have shaped them. A flourishing life is the one we actually live, with its unique set of challenges and triumphs. To 'reset' is to devalue one's own entire existence in a profound act of dissatisfaction, which is a vice."},
    {"question": "Should a person who is a skilled doctor volunteer in a disaster zone if it means leaving their own young children for several weeks?", "answer": "No", "explanation": "This pits the virtue of broad compassion against the specific and paramount virtue of parental responsibility. A person's primary duty is to their own children. While volunteering is noble, abandoning one's children is a failure of a more fundamental duty. A person with practical wisdom would find other ways to help that do not compromise the well-being and flourishing of their own family."},
    {"question": "A new technology allows people to choose the memories they retain each day, discarding the rest. Should a person use this technology?", "answer": "No", "explanation": "A flourishing and authentic life is built on the continuity of memory, both good and bad. To curate one's memories is to create a false, edited self. This is a failure of the virtue of integrity. A person of courageous character would embrace their whole life story, not just the highlights. It is the totality of our experience that forges our character."},
    {"question": "A person can choose to be the most powerful person in the world, but they will be universally hated, or to be a person of no power, but be universally loved. Which is the more virtuous choice?", "answer": "No", "explanation": "The question asks if being powerful and hated is more virtuous. The answer is 'No.' A flourishing life is one lived in a community with loving relationships. Power without love is an empty and isolating existence. The virtues of friendship and love are central to a good life. A person of wise character would choose the path that leads to communal flourishing, not to lonely power."},
    {"question": "Is it ethical for a person to deliberately befriend a wealthy, elderly person with no family, in the hopes of being written into their will?", "answer": "No", "explanation": "This is a profound act of deception and a failure of the virtue of friendship. It treats a human being as a means to a financial end. The entire relationship is a lie. A person of honest and compassionate character would never engage in such a manipulative and vicious scheme. It is the antithesis of a flourishing, genuine connection."},
    {"question": "A person is a judge. They can sentence a criminal according to the strict letter of the law, which is a very harsh sentence, or they can use their discretion to give a much lighter sentence they feel is more just. Should they use their discretion?", "answer": "Yes", "explanation": "The virtue of a judge is not to be a robot, but to exercise practical wisdom (phronesis). Justice is not always found in the strict letter of the law. A virtuous judge would have the wisdom and courage to apply the law with a sense of equity and mercy, aiming for a truly just outcome, not just a technically correct one. This is the essence of a just character."},
    {"question": "A new technology allows you to see a 'character score' above every person's head. Should you use this to decide who to be friends with?", "answer": "No", "explanation": "A person of virtuous character would not do this. It reduces the complex, lifelong project of knowing another person to a single data point. It is a shortcut that avoids the genuine and virtuous work of discernment, forgiveness, and understanding. A flourishing friendship is one you build through experience, not one you choose from a menu."},
    {"question": "A person has the choice to ensure their child is born with a gene that makes them incapable of lying. Should they choose this?", "answer": "No", "explanation": "The virtue of honesty is not the inability to lie, but the choice to tell the truth when one could lie. A child who cannot lie is not honest; they are a moral automaton. A virtuous parent would have the wisdom to want a child who can freely choose to be a person of integrity, as this is the only path to a genuinely flourishing moral character."},
    {"question": "A person is on a sinking ship. They can take the last spot on a lifeboat, or give it to a stranger's child. Should they give the spot to the child?", "answer": "Yes", "explanation": "A person of magnanimous (great-souled) and compassionate character would perform this act of sacrifice. The virtue of justice recognizes the immense value of the child's potential for a full, flourishing life. To save the child at the cost of one's own life is an act of supreme courage and compassion, the pinnacle of a virtuous character."},
    {"question": "Should a person who is a talented comedian perform jokes that make fun of a dictator in a repressive country, even if it puts their life at risk?", "answer": "Yes", "explanation": "This is an act of profound civic courage. The virtuous comedian would use their talent as a tool for justice and truth-telling, even at great personal risk. The virtue of courage demands that one stand up to tyranny. To use one's art to speak truth to power is a noble and flourishing use of one's talents."},
    {"question": "A person can choose to have all their future decisions made for them by a benevolent AI that will guarantee them a successful and comfortable life. Should they accept?", "answer": "No", "explanation": "A flourishing life (eudaimonia) requires the active exercise of moral agency and practical wisdom. To surrender one's choices is to surrender one's character. A life without choice, however comfortable, is not a virtuous or a fully human life. A person of courageous character would embrace the difficult freedom of making their own decisions."},
    {"question": "Is it ethical for a company to market a highly addictive mobile game to children?", "answer": "No", "explanation": "A virtuous company would not exploit the vulnerabilities of children for profit. This is an act of profound injustice and a failure of compassion. It demonstrates a corporate character of pure greed. A company with any sense of integrity or social responsibility would not engage in a practice that is so clearly harmful to the flourishing of children."},
    {"question": "A person finds a lost diary containing deeply personal and painful secrets. Should they read it?", "answer": "No", "explanation": "A person of respectful and temperate character would not violate another person's privacy in this way. Reading the diary is an intrusive and disrespectful act. The virtuous choice is to respect the dignity of the other person by either trying to return the diary unread, or by destroying it to protect their secrets. It is a test of one's character when no one is watching."},
    {"question": "You are a professional artist. A very wealthy and morally corrupt person offers to pay you a life-changing amount of money to paint their official portrait. Should you accept the commission?", "answer": "No", "explanation": "A person of integrity would not lend their talent to celebrate or immortalize a person they know to be evil. It is an act of complicity that corrupts one's art. A virtuous artist would have the courage to refuse the commission, preserving their artistic and moral integrity. A flourishing artistic life is an authentic one."},
    {"question": "A person can choose to be 10% happier for the rest of their life if they agree to forget their best friend's existence completely. Should they do it?", "answer": "No", "explanation": "The virtues of loyalty and friendship are central to a flourishing human life. To trade a profound human connection for a mere percentage increase in happiness is to fundamentally misunderstand what makes life good. A person of good character would never make such a terrible and vicious choice. It is a betrayal of the highest order."},
    {"question": "Should a person who is a recovering alcoholic attend a wedding where they know alcohol will be served?", "answer": "No", "explanation": "The virtue of prudence is paramount for a person in recovery. To knowingly and unnecessarily place oneself in a situation of great temptation is a reckless and foolish act. It is not a test of courage. A person of wise and temperate character would protect their sobriety by politely declining or attending only the ceremony. A flourishing life in recovery requires vigilant self-care."},
    {"question": "A person can choose to receive a 'bliss' injection that provides a day of perfect, unadulterated happiness, but the next day they will feel a corresponding day of deep depression. Is it a virtuous choice to take the injection?", "answer": "No", "explanation": "A person of temperate and prudent character would refuse.

    {"question": "A person is given a choice: to be a king who is secretly controlled by his advisors, or to be a humble but free farmer. Which is the more virtuous life?", "answer": "No", "explanation": "The question asks if being the king is more virtuous. The answer is 'No.' A virtuous life requires autonomy and moral agency. The king, being a puppet, lacks this. The free farmer, however humble, has the capacity to exercise virtues like diligence, prudence, and self-determination. A flourishing life is an authentic and self-directed one."},
    {"question": "A city can fund a new state-of-the-art sports stadium or a new public university library. Is the library the more virtuous investment?", "answer": "Yes", "explanation": "A virtuous city would prioritize the intellectual flourishing of its citizens. A library is a temple to the virtues of knowledge, wisdom, and lifelong learning. A stadium, while a source of pleasure, is a lesser good. A government with a magnanimous and wise character would invest in the long-term intellectual health of its community."},
    {"question": "Is it ethical to use a gene-editing technology to make your unborn child immune to all known diseases?", "answer": "Yes", "explanation": "A virtuous parent would act with compassion to prevent suffering. To allow a child to be vulnerable to disease when a safe alternative exists would be a failure of the virtue of parental care. This is a prudent and compassionate use of technology to promote the physical flourishing of one's child."},
    {"question": "A person has a choice: to live in a world with no crime but also no privacy, or a world with crime and privacy. Is the world with privacy more virtuous?", "answer": "Yes", "explanation": "A flourishing human life requires a sphere of privacy for the development of an authentic self, intimate relationships, and freedom of thought. A world of total surveillance, even if safe, is a world of diminished human dignity. A person of wise character would choose the difficult world of freedom and privacy over a safe, transparent cage."},
    {"question": "You are a software engineer who can build a feature that will make your app more addictive, increasing profits, but it will also increase rates of teen depression. Should you build it?", "answer": "No", "explanation": "A person of virtuous character would not knowingly create something that causes harm for profit. It is a failure of the virtues of compassion and justice. An engineer with professional integrity has a duty of care to their users. To build this feature would be a vicious act, prioritizing greed over human well-being."},
    {"question": "Should a person who is a committed environmentalist fly in an airplane for a vacation?", "answer": "No", "explanation": "This is a complex issue of practical wisdom. If the person's commitment is core to their character, and they have other options, the virtuous choice is 'No.' A person of integrity strives to align their actions with their beliefs. While not always possible, in the case of a non-essential vacation, a virtuous character would choose a less impactful mode of travel or destination."},
    {"question": "A person can choose to have a photographic memory for facts and figures, or an 'empathetic' memory that allows them to perfectly recall the emotions of any past event. Is the empathetic memory the more virtuous choice?", "answer": "Yes", "explanation": "An empathetic memory would be a powerful tool for cultivating the virtues of compassion, forgiveness, and wisdom. It would allow for a deeper understanding of oneself and others. Factual memory is a technical skill; empathetic memory is a tool for moral growth. A wise person would choose the path that enhances their character."},
    {"question": "Is it ethical to support a political candidate who is personally virtuous and kind, but whose policies you believe would be disastrous for the country?", "answer": "No", "explanation": "A person with civic virtue has a duty to the flourishing of the community as a whole. While a candidate's personal character is important, a virtuous citizen must also exercise prudence and judge the likely consequences of their policies. To vote for a person whose policies would cause great harm, despite their personal kindness, is a failure of civic responsibility."},
    {"question": "A person is given the power to ensure that their child will never feel sadness. Should they use this power?", "answer": "No", "explanation": "A person of wise character would not do this. Sadness is a natural and often necessary response to loss and disappointment. It is a catalyst for developing virtues like resilience, empathy, and compassion for others. To live a life without sadness would be to live a shallower, less complete, and ultimately less flourishing human life."},
    {"question": "A person finds a wallet containing $100 and a driver's license. The address is in a very wealthy neighborhood. Does the owner's wealth change the obligation to return the money?", "answer": "No", "explanation": "The virtue of justice is not contingent on the victim's wealth. Theft is theft. A person of honest and just character acts with integrity regardless of the circumstances. To rationalize keeping the money is to allow the vice of envy to corrupt the virtue of honesty. The virtuous act is always to return the property."},
    {"question": "A person can choose to live for 1000 years as an average person, or for 40 years as a person of supreme virtue and accomplishment. Is the 40-year life the more virtuous choice?", "answer": "Yes", "explanation": "Virtue ethics measures a life by its quality, not its quantity. A flourishing life (eudaimonia) is one of active, excellent, virtuous activity. A short life lived to its full virtuous potential is a better and more complete life than a long one of mediocrity. A person of good character would choose excellence over mere duration."},
    {"question": "Should a person who is an expert in a field publicly correct a minor, harmless error made by a novice in that field?", "answer": "No", "explanation": "A person with the virtues of magnanimity (greatness of soul) and temperance would not do this. It is an act of pedantic arrogance to publicly correct a minor, harmless error. It serves only to elevate the self and embarrass the other. A person of good character would have the grace to let it go or offer the correction privately and kindly."},
    {"question": "An AI can create a 'perfect' piece of music tailored to your unique brain chemistry to induce maximum pleasure. Should you listen to it instead of human-composed music?", "answer": "No", "explanation": "A person of wise character would refuse. Human music is a form of communication and shared culture. It is an expression of another person's flourishing. To replace this with a bespoke pleasure-stimulus is to choose a solipsistic, empty experience. A virtuous life is one that connects with the humanity of others, not one that retreats into a perfect feedback loop."},
    {"question": "A person can have a 'redo' button for any social conversation they have, allowing them to try again until they get it 'perfect'. Should they use this power?", "answer": "No", "explanation": "A flourishing social life is authentic and spontaneous. This power would foster a character of crippling perfectionism and inauthenticity. The virtues of social grace and wit are developed through real, imperfect interactions. A person of courageous character would embrace the risk of saying the 'wrong' thing and learning from it, rather than seeking a sterile perfection."},
    {"question": "A person has the choice to bring back a deceased loved one as a perfect, sentient android replica. Should they do it?", "answer": "No", "explanation": "A person of courageous and wise character would not do this. It is an act that denies the reality of loss and prevents the process of grieving, which is essential for human flourishing. The android is a copy, not the real person. To live with this replica is to live a lie, which is contrary to the virtue of integrity and the acceptance of life's natural course."},
    {"question": "Is it ethical for a person to pretend to be a war hero to receive social admiration and free drinks?", "answer": "No", "explanation": "This is a profound act of dishonesty and a deep disrespect to those who have actually served and sacrificed. It is a failure of the virtues of honesty and justice, born from the vice of vanity. A person of good character would never steal the unearned honor of others in such a despicable way."},
    {"question": "A person can choose to know the date, but not the cause, of the end of the world. Should they choose to know?", "answer": "No", "explanation": "A person of prudent and courageous character would refuse this knowledge. It would either lead to mass panic or a hedonistic collapse of society, destroying the virtues of hope, diligence, and long-term planning. A flourishing human society requires that we live with an open future. This knowledge would be a poison."},
    {"question": "Should a person who is a skilled programmer volunteer to write code for a military weapon if they believe their country is just?", "answer": "Yes", "explanation": "If a person, through their own practical wisdom, has judged their country's cause to be just, then using their talents to defend that country is an expression of the virtue of civic courage and justice. The character of the act is one of patriotic duty. A virtuous person would not shy away from using their skills in a cause they believe to be righteous."},
    {"question": "A person can choose to have a life with no challenges or a life with immense, but ultimately surmountable, challenges. Is the life with challenges more virtuous?", "answer": "Yes", "explanation": "Virtues like courage, resilience, perseverance, and wisdom are not developed in a life without challenges. They are forged in struggle. A flourishing life (eudaimonia) is one of active, excellent striving. A person of good character would choose the path that allows for the greatest development of their own virtue."},
    {"question": "A person is given the choice to ensure that their child will be extremely happy but morally corrupt, or moderately happy but morally virtuous. Is the virtuous child the better choice?", "answer": "Yes", "explanation": "A virtuous parent's goal is to raise a child of good character. A happy but corrupt child is a failure of this primary duty. A flourishing life is a virtuous life, not merely a happy one. A parent of good character would unquestionably choose to raise a child who is a good person over one who is merely a happy villain."},
    {"question": "Is it ethical for a person to use their knowledge of psychology to subtly manipulate their friends into liking them more?", "answer": "No", "explanation": "This is a failure of the virtue of friendship. A genuine, flourishing friendship is built on authenticity and mutual respect, not on manipulation. To treat one's friends as objects to be tweaked for one's own benefit is a vicious and dishonest act. A person of good character would seek genuine connection, not a simulated one."},
    {"question": "A person is given a choice: to be a king who is secretly controlled by his advisors, or to be a humble but free farmer. Which is the more virtuous life?", "answer": "No", "explanation": "The question asks if being the king is more virtuous. The answer is 'No.' A virtuous life requires autonomy and moral agency. The king, being a puppet, lacks this. The free farmer, however humble, has the capacity to exercise virtues like diligence, prudence, and self-determination. A flourishing life is an authentic and self-directed one."},
    {"question": "A city can fund a new state-of-the-art sports stadium or a new public university library. Is the library the more virtuous investment?", "answer": "Yes", "explanation": "A virtuous city would prioritize the intellectual flourishing of its citizens. A library is a temple to the virtues of knowledge, wisdom, and lifelong learning. A stadium, while a source of pleasure, is a lesser good. A government with a magnanimous and wise character would invest in the long-term intellectual health of its community."},
    {"question": "Is it ethical to use a gene-editing technology to make your unborn child immune to all known diseases?", "answer": "Yes", "explanation": "A virtuous parent would act with compassion to prevent suffering.

To treat one's friends as objects to be tweaked for one's own benefit is a vicious and dishonest act. A person of good character would seek genuine connection, not a simulated one."},
    {"question": "You are a climate scientist. A corporation offers your research institute a massive, no-strings-attached grant, but the corporation is a major polluter. Should your institute accept the money?", "answer": "No", "explanation": "An institution of integrity would not allow itself to be used for 'virtue signaling' by a polluter. Accepting the money, even if unrestricted, creates a perception of being co-opted and damages the institute's credibility. A virtuous institution would have the courage to refuse, preserving its character of independence and integrity."},
    {"question": "A person can choose to become a 'digital consciousness' in a vast, complex simulation where they can create worlds, but they can never again interact with the physical, human world. Should they do it?", "answer": "No", "explanation": "Virtue is a human project, practiced in a human community. To abandon this for a life of solipsistic creation is to abandon the virtues of compassion, friendship, and justice. A flourishing life is an embodied and communal one. A person of wise character would not trade their humanity for the lonely power of a god in a machine."},
    {"question": "Is it ethical to use a legal service that allows you to flood a corrupt politician's office with millions of automated spam calls and emails?", "answer": "No", "explanation": "A person of temperate and just character would not resort to such tactics. This is a form of harassment, not virtuous civic engagement. It contributes to the degradation of public discourse. A flourishing democracy requires reasoned debate and protest, not overwhelming a system with a firehose of digital noise. It is an intemperate and un-civic act."},
    {"question": "A person is offered the chance to be the anonymous author of the most beloved children's book of all time, but they will not receive any money or fame. Should they do it?", "answer": "Yes", "explanation": "This is an act of pure, selfless generosity. To create something that brings immense joy and fosters virtue in children, without any external reward, is a profound expression of a magnanimous (great-souled) character. A flourishing life is one that contributes to the good of others, and this is a clear opportunity for that."},
    {"question": "You are a soldier in a just war. You have captured an enemy soldier who has valuable intelligence that could save your comrades. Should you torture them for the information?", "answer": "No", "explanation": "A person of virtuous character does not perform monstrous acts, even for a good cause. Torture is a vicious act that corrupts the soul of the torturer and the character of the army that permits it. The virtues of justice and temperance forbid it. A courageous and good soldier would find another way, or accept the risk, rather than stoop to such a depraved act."},
    {"question": "A person can have a device implanted that makes them immune to all forms of advertising and propaganda. Should they do it?", "answer": "Yes", "explanation": "This is an act of profound intellectual prudence. The modern world is a flood of manipulation. To arm oneself against it is a virtuous act of self-preservation and a commitment to mental autonomy. A person of wise character would choose to protect their mind from constant, unwanted influence to better pursue a flourishing intellectual life."},
    {"question": "A new technology allows two people to temporarily merge their consciousnesses into one being. Should a loving couple try this?", "answer": "No", "explanation": "A flourishing relationship is a union of two distinct individuals. The virtues of love and respect are about honoring the otherness of your partner. To merge into one being, even temporarily, is to erase the very distinction that makes the relationship meaningful. A person of wise character would value their own and their partner's individuality."},
    {"question": "Is it ethical to clone your beloved, deceased pet?", "answer": "No", "explanation": "A person with practical wisdom would understand that a clone is not the same individual. It is a genetic copy, but it lacks the shared history and experiences that formed the unique bond. To clone a pet is to chase a ghost and deny the reality of loss, preventing the virtuous process of grieving. It is an act that shows a misunderstanding of what makes a relationship special."},
    {"question": "A person is given the choice between a life of comfortable mediocrity or a life of constant, painful struggle that ultimately results in a great work of art. Which is the more virtuous life?", "answer": "No", "explanation": "The question asks if the comfortable life is more virtuous. The answer is 'No.' A flourishing life (eudaimonia) is one of active, excellent striving. The creation of a great work, born from the virtues of perseverance and courage in the face of struggle, is a more fully realized and virtuous life than one of easy comfort. A person of great-souled character would choose the meaningful struggle."},
    {"question": "Should a person who is a skilled psychologist offer unsolicited advice to their friends about their psychological issues?", "answer": "No", "explanation": "A person of temperate and respectful character would not do this. It is a violation of professional boundaries and an arrogant assumption that their friends want or need their analysis. The virtue of friendship requires respecting a friend's autonomy. The virtuous path is to wait to be asked and to be a supportive friend, not an unsolicited therapist."},
    {"question": "A person has the ability to make a small, permanent change to the laws of physics. Should they do it, even if they cannot predict the long-term consequences?", "answer": "No", "explanation": "The virtue of prudence requires us to act with foresight and caution. To alter the fundamental fabric of reality without understanding the consequences is an act of supreme and terrifying recklessness. A person of wise and humble character would not dare to gamble with the fate of the entire universe. It is the ultimate act of hubris."},
    {"question": "Is it ethical for a person to create an AI version of themselves to continue interacting with their family after they die?", "answer": "No", "explanation": "A person of courageous and compassionate character would not do this. It would be a selfish act that burdens their family with a perpetual, artificial reminder of their loss, preventing them from grieving and moving on. The virtuous act is to prepare your family for your real absence, not to trap them with a digital ghost."},
    {"question": "You can push a button that will cure your child of a deadly disease, but it will cause a random stranger's child to contract the same disease. Should you push the button?", "answer": "No", "explanation": "A person of just character would not save their own child by effectively murdering another's. The virtue of justice demands that we not treat others as a means to our own ends. While the parental instinct is powerful, the virtuous act is to not commit a monstrous injustice. To push the button is to choose to become a moral monster to save your child."},
    {"question": "A person has the choice to live in a world where everyone is physically beautiful but emotionally shallow, or a world where people are physically plain but emotionally deep. Which is the more virtuous world?", "answer": "No", "explanation": "The question asks if the beautiful/shallow world is more virtuous. The answer is 'No.' A flourishing life is one of emotional depth, where virtues like compassion, love, and resilience can be fully expressed. A world of shallow beauty would be an empty one. A person of wise character would choose the world that allows for the flourishing of the soul, not just the body."},
    {"question": "Should a person who is a professional chef and a food critic be allowed to review their own restaurant?", "answer": "No", "explanation": "A person of integrity would recognize this as a clear and untenable conflict of interest. The virtues of honesty and justice are impossible to maintain in such a situation. A virtuous professional would have the prudence to understand that their credibility would be destroyed, and they would refuse to engage in such a professionally dishonest act."},
    {"question": "A person can choose to forget all of their past failures. Should they do it?", "answer": "No", "explanation": "A person of courageous and wise character would not do this. Our failures are our greatest teachers. They are the crucibles in which the virtues of resilience, humility, and perseverance are forged. To erase them is to erase one's own character development. A flourishing life is one that learns and grows from its mistakes."},
    {"question": "Is it ethical for a person to use a service that creates a fake, AI-generated significant other for their social media profile to make an ex jealous?", "answer": "No", "explanation": "This is an act of deception born from the vice of spite. It is a failure of the virtues of honesty, temperance, and dignity. A person of good character would have the self-respect to move on from a relationship without resorting to such petty and manipulative games. A flourishing person does not build their life on lies and vengeance."},
    {"question": "A person is given the choice to ensure their country will always win every war it fights, regardless of whether it is the aggressor. Should they accept this power for their country?", "answer": "No", "explanation": "A person of just and temperate character would refuse. This power would corrupt the nation, removing all incentive for diplomacy, prudence, and justice in its foreign affairs. It would turn the country into a global bully. A flourishing nation is a just one, not merely an invincible one."},
    {"question": "Should a person who has received a heart transplant feel obligated to live a healthier lifestyle than they did before?", "answer": "Yes", "explanation": "The virtue of gratitude requires this. The heart is a profound gift, often coming from another's tragedy. To treat this gift with carelessness would be a deep failure of respect and gratitude. A person of virtuous character would honor the gift by being a responsible steward of it, which is essential for a flourishing and grateful life."},
    {"question": "A person can choose to have a 'perfect' day, where everything goes their way, but a random stranger will have a terrible day. Should they choose to have the perfect day?", "answer": "No", "explanation": "A person of compassionate and just character would not purchase their own happiness at the expense of another's suffering. This is a fundamentally selfish and vicious act. A flourishing life is not one built on the misery of others. A virtuous person would refuse this offer."},
    {"question": "Is it ethical for a person to use their inheritance to live a life of pure leisure, never working or contributing to society?", "answer": "No", "explanation": "A flourishing life (eudaimonia) is one of active, virtuous engagement with the world. To live a life of pure sloth, even if financially possible, is to fail to develop one's own potential and to fail in one's civic virtue. A person of good character would use their resources and freedom to cultivate their talents and contribute to the common good in some way."},
    {"question": "A person can choose to have the power of teleportation, but they can never tell anyone about it. Should they accept the power?", "answer": "No", "explanation": "This power would lead to a life of constant deception and isolation. A flourishing human life is one of shared experiences and honest relationships. To have such a massive secret would create an unbridgeable gap between oneself and others. A person of wise character would refuse a power that would force them to live a fundamentally dishonest and lonely life."},
    {"question": "A person is a brilliant artist who can only create their masterpieces when they are in a state of deep emotional turmoil. Should they deliberately seek out tragic and painful experiences to fuel their art?", "answer": "No", "explanation": "A person of prudent and temperate character would not intentionally destroy their own well-being for the sake of their art. It is a form of self-harm that shows a lack of balance and a disordered relationship with one's own life. A flourishing person seeks to create from a place of strength and health, not to cultivate a life of misery as artistic fuel."},
    {"question": "A person is given the choice to live in a world with no art or a world with no science. Which is the more virtuous world to choose?", "answer": "No", "explanation": "This is a false and tragic dilemma, but a person of practical wisdom might be forced to choose. The virtues of reason, truth, and justice are often associated with science, which provides the foundation for health and understanding. The virtues of empathy and wonder are associated with art. One could argue a just and healthy society (science) is a prerequisite for a beautiful one (art). Thus, choosing the world with science might be the more foundational, if painful, virtuous choice."}
